# Prompts

Exploring correct libraries for my needs

```
You are an expert in developing Graph RAG (Retrieval Augmented generation) based solutions. Based on the following needs, please suggest a ready framework that accomplishes most of these needs. Also evaluate given ready frameworks or anything else, against the same needs.

## needs
- It should have configuration to use open-source LLMs (Large Language Models) via localhost openai like APIs or LM studio
- It should have separate modules for Knowledge Graph construction, Graph Indexing and Graph querying. So, that optionally, a ready knowledge graph can be imported from CSV or network x objects and then further RAG steps like indexing and querying can be done.
- It should have extend-ability to support: Indian languages embedding LLMs, Text-to-GraphQL or Cypher way of querying graphs and retrieval can get back node-edge-triplets.

### Implementation Example

```python
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader, ServiceContext
from llama_index.graph_stores import NetworkxGraphStore
from llama_index.indices.knowledge_graph import KnowledgeGraphIndex
from llama_index.llms import OpenAI
import os

# Configure for local LLM
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "dummy-key"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_BASE"] = "http://localhost:8000/v1"  # Point to LM Studio or other local API

# Create custom LLM wrapper (for open-source models)
llm = OpenAI(model="local-model", temperature=0.1)
service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(llm=llm)

# Option 1: Build KG from documents
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data").load_data()
kg_index = KnowledgeGraphIndex.from_documents(
    documents, 
    service_context=service_context,
    include_embeddings=True
)

# Option 2: Import existing KG (NetworkX)
import networkx as nx
graph = nx.read_graphml("existing_graph.graphml")
graph_store = NetworkxGraphStore(graph)
kg_index = KnowledgeGraphIndex(
    [],  # empty docs when importing
    graph_store=graph_store,
    service_context=service_context
)

# Query the graph
query_engine = kg_index.as_query_engine(
    include_text=False,  # Return only KG triplets
    response_mode="tree"  # Structured response
)
response = query_engine.query("Your query here")
```

## Other Alternatives Worth Considering

1. **Neo4j with langchain-neo4j**: Good if you need enterprise-grade graph database capabilities with RAG integration.

2. **Haystack by Deepset**: Strong in pipeline customization with graph modules, though slightly less focused on knowledge graphs than LlamaIndex.

3. **GraphGPT**: More specialized for graph-based RAG, but with less flexibility for custom LLMs.

pythonfrom llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, ServiceContext
from llama_index.graph_stores import NetworkxGraphStore
from llama_index.indices.knowledge_graph import KnowledgeGraphIndex
from llama_index.llms import OpenAI

# Configure local LLM
llm = OpenAI(api_base="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="dummy-key")
service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(llm=llm)

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of either framework's implementation?RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.YKIs it possible to create hierarchical summaries after kg indexation in both?EditHierarchical Summaries in Knowledge Graph RAG
Yes, both LlamaIndex and Langchain support hierarchical summary generation after knowledge graph indexation, though they implement this capability in different ways:
LlamaIndex Hierarchical Summaries
LlamaIndex provides more straightforward, built-in support for hierarchical summarization:
pythonfrom llama_index.indices.knowledge_graph import KnowledgeGraphIndex
from llama_index.query_engine import RouterQueryEngine
from llama_index.retrievers import KGHierarchicalRetriever

# Assuming kg_index is your existing KnowledgeGraphIndex
# Create hierarchical retriever
hierarchical_retriever = KGHierarchicalRetriever(
    kg_index,
    include_text=True,
    retrieve_node_info=True,
    child_types=["part_of", "contains", "is_a"]  # Define relationship hierarchy
)

# Create query engine with hierarchical summarization
query_engine = kg_index.as_query_engine(
    retriever=hierarchical_retriever,
    response_synthesizer=response_synthesizer_with_hierarchy
)

# Generate hierarchical summary
response = query_engine.query("Summarize this knowledge domain hierarchically")
LlamaIndex also offers ComposableGraph for explicit hierarchical structuring:
pythonfrom llama_index.indices.composability import ComposableGraph

# Create subgraphs for different hierarchical levels
subgraph_1 = KnowledgeGraphIndex(documents_level1)
subgraph_2 = KnowledgeGraphIndex(documents_level2)

# Create hierarchical composable graph
graph = ComposableGraph.from_indices(
    KnowledgeGraphIndex,
    [subgraph_1, subgraph_2],
    index_summaries=["Level 1 summary", "Level 2 summary"]
)

# Query with hierarchical awareness
query_engine = graph.as_query_engine()
response = query_engine.query("Generate hierarchical summary")
Langchain Hierarchical Summaries
Langchain requires more custom implementation but offers greater flexibility:
pythonfrom langchain.chains import GraphSummarizationChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Define hierarchical summary prompt
hierarchical_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    template="""
    Create a hierarchical summary of the following knowledge graph:
    1. First summarize the top-level concepts
    2. Then identify key relationships between concepts
    3. For each major concept, summarize its sub-concepts and relationships
    4. Present the information in a nested hierarchical structure
    
    Knowledge graph context: {graph_info}
    """,
    input_variables=["graph_info"]
)

# Create hierarchical summarization chain
hierarchy_chain = GraphSummarizationChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    graph=knowledge_graph,
    prompt=hierarchical_prompt
)

# Generate hierarchical summary
hierarchical_summary = hierarchy_chain.run(
    query="Generate hierarchical summary",
    level_depth=3  # How many levels to include
)
Langchain also supports recursive summarization through chaining:
pythonfrom langchain.chains import SequentialChain
from langchain.chains.graph_qa.base import GraphQAChain

# Create component chains for different hierarchy levels
top_level_chain = GraphQAChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    graph=knowledge_graph,
    top_k=5  # Only top concepts
)

detail_chain = GraphQAChain.from_llm(
    llm=llm,
    graph=knowledge_graph
)

# Chain them together for hierarchical processing
hierarchical_chain = SequentialChain(
    chains=[top_level_chain, detail_chain],
    input_variables=["query"],
    output_variables=["hierarchical_summary"]
)

# Generate hierarchical summary
response = hierarchical_chain.run("Create a hierarchical summary")
Comparison
LlamaIndex Advantages:

More built-in support via KGHierarchicalRetriever
Cleaner implementation with less custom code
ComposableGraph specifically designed for hierarchical structures

Langchain Advantages:

More customizable prompting for hierarchy construction
Greater control over the summarization process
Better handling of complex relationship types across hierarchy levels

Both frameworks can accomplish hierarchical summarization effectively, but LlamaIndex provides more out-of-the-box support while Langchain offers more flexibility for custom hierarchical summarization logic.
