Club\", wrote that \"things become sort of uncomfortable\" in the scene in \"Sick\" where Rick chases Andrew into a courtyard full of zombies and locks the door, noting that while Rick does not actually kill Andrew, \"it's a cold, cruel move, and it indicates a growing chill in Rick's character\". Lesley Goldberg of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" noted that in \"Killer Within\", Rick's decision to lock Andrew out \"amid a sea of walkers came back to bite the group in a major way\". Glen Mazzara felt that this decision would haunt Rick, as Rick \"believed he was committing an act of murder to save the group and that murder led to deaths within his own group and forced his own son to put down his mother\". \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Laura Hudson considered the identity of the mysterious figure breaking open the lock on the prison gates to be \"not that much of a \"mystery\" if you consider how many black guys there are running around outside the prison with vendettas against Rick (note: one)\". Ted Pigeon of\" Slant Magazine\" described the episode's opening sequence: \"With its dreamlike, foggy setting and a conspicuously waist-down perspective of the saboteur, a peculiar sense of disconnect underlines the implications of what's being depicted. The scene ends with a single close-up of a heart placed on the cold cement. It's a foreboding image that gains magnitude as \"Killer Within\" gives way to a sudden strike of tragedy. Moreover, the pre-credit sequence lends insight into how the episode amounts to a particularly poignant, if also problematic, entry in the show's run.\" Pigeon also notes that the opening segments of the episode \"establish the origins for the ensuing chaos while going to painstaking lengths to conceal the identity of the man that caused it\". HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall commented on Andrew's sabotage of the prison: \"on the one hand, it helps justify Rick's decision to chase after the little guy in the first place. On the other, it seemed like an overly-elaborate plan from someone who probably would have been better off just leaving once he managed to get the gate open.\" Bex Schwartz wrote in her review for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine that when Andrew (\"the tiny prisoner\") tries to get Oscar to shoot Rick, \"Oscar shoots Andrew instead, because Oscar understands life and death and remembers that Andrew was one of the bad dudes\". Moore commented on how Andrew died in the series: \" It's weird because I have so much fun playing bad guys and I loved the way Andrew went out!

In section one of The Dream of the Rood, the rood, which is from the Old English word r\u014dd 'pole', or more specifically 'crucifix', is drenched in precious gems, and eventually drenched in blood. In section two, the rood is drenched in gold and silver.","qa_pairs":[{"context":"The poem is set up with the narrator having a dream. In this dream or vision he is speaking to the Cross on which Jesus was crucified. The poem itself is divided up into three separate sections: the first part (ll. 1\u201327), the second part (ll. 28\u2013121) and the third part (ll. 122\u2013156). In section one, the narrator has a vision of the Cross. Initially when the dreamer sees the Cross, he notes how it is covered with gems. He is aware of how wretched he is compared to how glorious the tree is. However, he comes to see that amidst the beautiful stones it is stained with blood. In section two, the Cross shares its account of Jesus' death. The Crucifixion story is told from the perspective of the Cross. It begins with the enemy coming to cut the tree down and carrying it away. The tree learns that it is not to be the bearer of a criminal, but instead Christ crucified. The Lord and the Cross become one, and they stand together as victors, refusing to fall, taking on insurmountable pain for the sake of mankind. It is not just Christ, but the Cross as well that is pierced with nails. Adelhied L. J. Thieme remarks, \"The cross itself is portrayed as his lord's retainer whose most outstanding characteristic is that of unwavering loyalty\". The Rood and Christ are one in the portrayal of the Passion\u2014they are both pierced with nails, mocked and tortured. Then, just as with Christ, the Cross is resurrected, and adorned with gold and silver. It is honoured above all trees just as Jesus is honoured above all men. The Cross then charges the visionary to share all that he has seen with others. In section three, the author gives his reflections about this vision. The vision ends, and the man is left with his thoughts. He gives praise to God for what he has seen and is filled with hope for eternal life and his desire to once again be near the glorious Cross.","question":"In section one of the dream of the rood what is the rood eventually drenched in beyond the gems?","short_answers":["blood"],"wikipage":"Dream of the Rood"},{"context":"No context provided","question":"In section two of the dream of the rood what is the rood eventually drenched in?","short_answers":["gold and silver"],"wikipage":null},{"context":"No context provided","question":"In section one of the dream of the rood what precious items is the rood drenched in?","short_answers":["gems"],"wikipage":null}],"annotations":[{"knowledge":[{"content":"In section one, the narrator has a vision of the Cross.

The mantle is divided into upper and lower mantle, which are separated by the transition zone. The lowest part of the mantle next to the core-mantle boundary is known as the D\u2033 (pronounced dee-double-prime) layer. The pressure at the bottom of the mantle is \u2248140 GPa (1.4 Matm). The mantle is composed of silicate rocks that are rich in iron and magnesium relative to the overlying crust. Although solid, the high temperatures within the mantle cause the silicate material to be sufficiently ductile that it can flow on very long timescales. Convection of the mantle is expressed at the surface through the motions of tectonic plates. As there is intense and increasing pressure as one travels deeper into the mantle, the lower part of the mantle flows less easily than does the upper mantle (chemical changes within the mantle may also be important). The viscosity of the mantle ranges between 10 and 10 Pa\u00b7s, depending on depth. In comparison, the viscosity of water is approximately 10 Pa\u00b7s and that of pitch is 10 Pa\u00b7s.

","qa_pairs":[{"context":"Timpani (; ) or kettledrums (also informally called timps) are musical instruments in the percussion family. A type of drum categorised as a semispherical drum, they consist of a membrane called a head stretched over a large bowl traditionally made of copper. Most modern timpani are \"pedal timpani\" and can be tuned quickly and accurately to specific pitches by skilled players through the use of a movable foot-pedal. They are played by striking the head with a specialized drum stick called a \"timpani stick\" or \"timpani mallet\". Timpani evolved from military drums to become a staple of the classical orchestra by the last third of the 18th century. Today, they are used in many types of ensembles, including concert bands, marching bands, orchestras, and even in some rock bands.","question":"What is a set of kettledrums in an orchestra called in modern English?","short_answers":["Timpani","timps"],"wikipage":"Timpani"},{"context":"First attested in English in the late 19th century, the Italian word \"timpani\" derives from the Latin \"tympanum\" (pl. \"tympana\"), which is the latinisation of the Greek word \u03c4\u03cd\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (\"tumpanon\", pl. \"tumpana\"), \"a hand drum\", which in turn derives from the verb \u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03c4\u03c9 (\"tupt\u014d\"), meaning \"to strike, to hit\".

The Meat Inspection Act was assigned to what is now known as the Food Safety and Inspection Service, which remains in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The first federal law regulating foods and drugs, the 1906 Act's reach was limited to foods and drugs moving in interstate commerce. Although the law drew upon many precedents, provisions, and legal experiments pioneered in individual states, the federal law defined \"misbranding\" and \"adulteration\" for the first time and prescribed penalties for each. The law recognized the U.S. Pharmacopeia and the National Formulary as standards authorities for drugs, but made no similar provision for federal food standards. The law was principally a \"truth in labeling\" law designed to raise standards in the food and drug industries and protect the reputations and pocketbooks of honest businessmen.","question":"Who signed the Pure Food and Drug Act into law?|Which president signed the passage of the Pure Food and Drug act?","short_answers":["Theodore Roosevelt","President Theodore Roosevelt"],"wikipage":"Pure Food and Drug Act"},{"context":"The was the first of a series of significant consumer protection laws which was enacted by Congress in the 20th century and led to the creation of the Food and Drug Administration.

Spatial recruitment is the activation of more motor units to produce a greater force. Larger motor units contract along with small motor units until all muscle fibers in a single muscle are activated, thus producing the maximum muscle force. Temporal motor unit recruitment, or rate coding, deals with the frequency of activation of muscle fiber contractions. Consecutive stimulation on the motor unit fibres from the alpha motor neuron causes the muscle to twitch more frequently until the twitches \"fuse\" temporally.

{"question":"Who coined the phrase manifest destiny and what does it mean?","answer":"Manifest destiny was a widely held cultural belief in the 19th-century United States that American settlers were destined to expand across North America.

The unsigned editorial titled \"Annexation\" in which it first appeared was arguably written by journalist and annexation advocate Jane Cazneau.

The term was used by Democrats in the 1840s to justify the war with Mexico and it was also used to divide half of Oregon with Great Britain. However, manifest destiny always limped along because of its internal limitations and the issue of slavery, says Merk. It never became a national priority. By 1843, former U.S. President John Quincy Adams, originally a major supporter of the concept underlying manifest destiny, had changed his mind and repudiated expansionism because it meant the expansion of slavery in Texas.","question":"Who is generally credited with coined the phrase manifest destiny?","short_answers":["John O'Sullivan"],"wikipage":"Manifest destiny"},{"context":"No context provided","question":"Who is thought to have thought in the annexation coined the phrase manifest destiny?","short_answers":["Jane Cazneau"],"wikipage":null},{"context":"No context provided","question":"What does the phrase manifest destiny mean?","short_answers":["extending the area of freedom","\"a sense of mission to redeem the Old World by high example ... generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven"],"wikipage":null}],"annotations":[{"knowledge":[{"content":"Manifest destiny was a widely held cultural belief in the 19th-century United States that American settlers were destined to expand across North America.","wikipage":"Manifest destiny"}],"long_answer":"Manifest destiny was a widely held cultural belief in the 19th-century United States.

In the northern latitudes, beyond 72\u00b0 north experiences the greatest annual change in daylight hours. In the southern latitudes, beyond 72\u00b0 experiences the greatest annual change in daylight hours as well.","qa_pairs":[{"context":"Around the poles, which coincide with the rotational axis of Earth as it passes through the surface, the seasonal variations in the length of daytime are extreme. In fact, within 23.44\u00b0 latitude of the poles, there will be at least some days each year during which the sun never goes below the horizon. There will also be days when the Sun never rises above the horizon. This number will be fewer, but close to the number of days in the summer where the sun doesn't set (for example the sunrise is usually a few days before the spring equinox and extends a few days past the fall equinox). This phenomenon of more daylight than night is not unique to the poles. In fact, at any given time slightly more than half of the earth is in daylight. The 24 hours of summer daylight is known as the midnight sun that is famous in some northern countries. To the north, the Arctic Circle marks this 23.44\u00b0 boundary. To the south, the Antarctic Circle marks the boundary. These boundaries correspond to 66.56\u00b0 north or south latitude, respectively.

{"question":"When was the first bottle of champagne made?","answer":"Champagne is a sparkling wine produced in the Champagne wine region of France under the rules of the appellation, that demand specific vineyard practices, sourcing of grapes exclusively from designated places within it, specific grape-pressing methods and secondary fermentation of the wine in the bottle to cause carbonation. The method for making champagne was first developed in 1662. The first champagne was bottled in 1663.","qa_pairs":[{"context":"An initial burst of effervescence occurs when the Champagne contacts the dry glass on pouring. These bubbles form on imperfections in the glass that facilitate nucleation or, to a minimal extent, on cellulose fibres left over from the wiping\/drying process as shown with a high-speed video camera. However, after the initial rush, these naturally occurring imperfections are typically too small to consistently act as nucleation points as the surface tension of the liquid smooths out these minute irregularities. The nucleation sites that act as a source for the ongoing effervescence are not natural imperfections in the glass, but actually occur where the glass has been etched by the manufacturer or the customer. This etching is typically done with acid, a laser, or a glass etching tool from a craft shop to provide nucleation sites for continuous bubble formation (note that not all glasses are etched in this way). In 1662 this method was developed in England, as records from the Royal Society show.","question":"When was the method for making the first champagne created?","short_answers":["1662"],"wikipage":"Champagne"},{"context":"No context provided","question":"When was champagne first able to be bottled?","short_answers":["1663"],"wikipage":null}],"annotations":[{"knowledge":[{"content":"Champagne (\/\u0283\u00e6m\u02c8pe\u026an\/, French: [\u0283\u0251\u0303pa\u0272]) is a sparkling wine produced in the Champagne wine region of France under the rules of the appellation,[1] that demand specific vineyard practices, sourcing of grapes exclusively from designated places within it, specific grape-pressing methods and secondary fermentation of the wine in the bottle to cause carbonation.","wikipage":"Champagne"}],"long_answer":"Champagne is a sparkling wine produced in the Champagne wine region of France.

{"question":"Where does most star formation take place in the milky way?","answer":"The Milky Way is the galaxy that includes our Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The Milky Way appears to have two spiral arms as traced by old stars and four spiral arms as traced by gas and young stars. The nature of the Milky Way's bar is actively debated, with estimates for its half-length and orientation spanning from and 10\u201350 degrees relative to the line of sight from Earth to the Galactic Center. The bar may be surrounded by a ring called the \"5-kpc ring\" that contains a large fraction of the molecular hydrogen present in the Milky Way, as well as most of the Milky Way's star formation activity.","qa_pairs":[{"context":"Two spiral arms, the Scutum\u2013Centaurus arm and the Carina\u2013Sagittarius arm, have tangent points inside the Sun's orbit about the center of the Milky Way. If these arms contain an overdensity of stars compared to the average density of stars in the Galactic disk, it would be detectable by counting the stars near the tangent point. Two surveys of near-infrared light, which is sensitive primarily to red giants and not affected by dust extinction, detected the predicted overabundance in the Scutum\u2013Centaurus arm but not in the Carina\u2013Sagittarius arm: the Scutum\u2013Centaurus Arm contains approximately 30% more red giants than would be expected in the absence of a spiral arm. This observation suggests that the Milky Way possesses only two major stellar arms: the Perseus arm and the Scutum\u2013Centaurus arm. The rest of the arms contain excess gas but not excess old stars. In December 2013, astronomers found that the distribution of young stars and star-forming regions matches the four-arm spiral description of the Milky Way.

Jagger and Mick Taylor also recorded a session together in London where Taylor added lead guitar to what would be the expanded album's single, \"Plundered My Soul\". On 17 April 2010, the band released a limited edition 7-inch vinyl single of the previously unreleased track \"Plundered My Soul\" as part of Record Store Day. The track, part of the group's 2010 re-issue of \"Exile on Main St.\", was combined with \"All Down the Line\" as its B-side.

After consulting with his pastor, who felt Millard should accept the opportunity, Millard began to reconsider, and finally agreed to let her cover it after talking with Grant over the phone.

The match was played at Davis's own snooker hall in Chesterfield. The match was close until Davis pulled away in the later stages, as he often did, winning 25\u201318. There were just two entries in 1934, Davis being opposed by Tom Newman, six times World Billiards Champion. The match was held partly in Nottingham before finishing in Kettering. Davis won 25\u201322, although Newman led 14\u201313 at one stage.","question":"Who is the man that has won the world snooker championship the most times?","short_answers":["Davis","Joe Davis"],"wikipage":"World Snooker Championship"},{"context":"No context provided","question":"What country has won the men's world snooker championship the most times all-time?","short_answers":["England"],"wikipage":null},{"context":"The World Snooker Championship is the leading snooker tournament both in terms of prestige and prize money.

In \"Beauty and the Beast\", \"Evermore\" appears as a solo performed by the Beast shortly before \"The Mob Song\" as the film approaches its dramatic climax. After the Beast and Belle (Emma Watson) share a dance in the castle's ballroom to Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson) singing \"Beauty and the Beast\", the couple has a conversation during which the Beast learns how much Belle actually misses her father, Maurice (Kevin Kline). Finally admitting that Belle is no longer his prisoner, the character sings \"Evermore\" shortly after he releases the heroine from the castle, insisting that she return to her village and protect Maurice from Gaston (Luke Evans). Believing that Belle has been lost to him forever, the Beast is heartbroken by the character's departure and laments his misfortune by performing \"Evermore\", accepting that releasing his former prisoner makes breaking the enchantress' spell more difficult, even impossible. Serving as a culmination of both the Beast's personal and emotional journeys, Tracy Goldman of \"The\" \"Cornell Daily Sun\" observed that the song \"adds more depth to the character\" by \"highlighting the changes he goes through throughout the movie.\"","question":"Which character sang the song evermore in the movie beauty and the beast?","short_answers":["Beast"],"wikipage":"Evermore (Beauty and the Beast song)"},{"context":"\"Evermore\" is a song written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice for the musical fantasy film \"Beauty and the Beast\" (2017), a live-action remake of Disney's 1991 animated film of the same name.

{"question":"Where do you find a simple gear train?","answer":"A transmission is a machine in a power transmission system, which provides controlled application of power. Often the term 5-speed transmission refers simply to the gearbox, that uses gears and gear trains to provide speed and torque block conversions from a rotating power source to another device. Simple gear trains are often found in gearboxes on machines as well as on non-motorized bicycles.","qa_pairs":[{"context":"The simplest transmissions, often called gearboxes to reflect their simplicity (although complex systems are also called gearboxes in the vernacular), provide gear reduction (or, more rarely, an increase in speed), sometimes in conjunction with a right-angle change in direction of the shaft (typically in helicopters, see picture). These are often used on PTO-powered agricultural equipment, since the axial PTO shaft is at odds with the usual need for the driven shaft, which is either vertical (as with rotary mowers), or horizontally extending from one side of the implement to another (as with manure spreaders, flail mowers, and forage wagons). More complex equipment, such as silage choppers and snowblowers, have drives with outputs in more than one direction. So too Helicopters use a split-torque gearbox where power is taken from the engine in two directions for the different rotors. The gearbox in a wind turbine converts the slow, high-torque rotation of the turbine into much faster rotation of the electrical generator. These are much larger and more complicated than the PTO gearboxes in farm equipment. They weigh several tons and typically contain three stages to achieve an overall gear ratio from 40:1 to over 100:1, depending on the size of the turbine. (For aerodynamic and structural reasons, larger turbines have to turn more slowly, but the generators all have to rotate at similar speeds of several thousand rpm.) The first stage of the gearbox is usually a planetary gear, for compactness, and to distribute the enormous torque of the turbine over more teeth of the low-speed shaft. Durability of these gearboxes has been a serious problem for a long time.","question":"What part of machines do you often find a simple gear train?","short_answers":["gearboxes","gearbox"],"wikipage":"Transmission (mechanics)"},{"context":"No context provided","question":"What non-motorized personal vehicle do you often find a simple gear train?","short_answers":["bike","bicycle","cycle"],"wikipage":null}],"annotations":[{"knowledge":[{"content":"A gear train is a mechanical system formed by mounting gears on a frame so the teeth of the gears engage.","wikipage":"Gear train"},{"content":"Gear teeth are designed to ensure the pitch circles of engaging gears roll on each other without slipping, providing a smooth transmission of rotation from one gear to the next","wikipage":"Gear train"},{"content":"Geared devices can change the speed, torque, and direction of a power source.","wikipage":"Gear"},{"content":"Gears of different sizes produce a change in torque, creating a mechanical advantage, through their gear ratio, and thus may be considered a simple machine.","wikipage":"Gear"}],"long_answer":"A gear train is a mechanical system formed by mounting gears on a frame with rotating, interlocking teeth.

{"question":"Where does the amazon river start and finish?","answer":"The Amazon River in South America is the largest river by discharge volume of water in the world, and the disputed longest river in the world.

The mouth of the Amazon River is in Brazil at the Atlantic Ocean.","qa_pairs":[{"context":"No context provided","question":"Where does the Amazon river start and end?","short_answers":["Mantaro River and Atlantic Ocean"],"wikipage":null},{"context":"No context provided","question":"Where was it commonly believed the Amazon river started and finished?","short_answers":["Apur\u00edmac River on Nevado Mismi and Atlantic Ocean"],"wikipage":null},{"context":"A 2014 study by Americans James Contos and Nicolas Tripcevich in \"Area\", a peer-reviewed journal of the Royal Geographical Society, however, identifies the most distant source of the Amazon as actually being in the R\u00edo Mantaro drainage. A variety of methods were used to compare the lengths of the Mantaro river vs. the Apur\u00edmac river from their most distant source points to their confluence, showing the longer length of the Mantaro. Then distances from Lago Jun\u00edn to several potential source points in the uppermost Mantaro river were measured, which enabled them to determine that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin (and therefore in the entire Amazon basin). The most accurate measurement method was direct GPS measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence (performed by Contos). Obtaining these measurements was difficult given the class IV\u2013V nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower \"Abyss\" sections.

In a healthy heart, the SA node continuously produces action potential, setting the rhythm of the heart and so is known as the heart's natural pacemaker. The normal resting heart rate is based on the at-rest firing rate of the heart's sinoatrial node. If the SA node does not function, or the impulse generated in the SA node is blocked before it travels down the electrical conduction system, a group of cells further down the heart will become its pacemaker.

If the AV node also fails, Purkinje fibers are occasionally capable of acting as the default or \"escape\" pacemaker.

An action potential is a change in voltage (membrane potential) across the membrane of the cell, produced by the movement of charged atoms (ions). Non-pacemaker cells (including the ventricular and atrial cells) have a period, immediately after an action potential, where the membrane potential remains relatively constant; this is known as a resting membrane potential. This resting phase (see cardiac action potential, phase 4) ends when another action potential reaches the cell. This produces a positive change in membrane potential (known as depolarisation), which initiates the start of the next action potential. Pacemaker cells, however, don\u2019t have this resting phase. Instead, immediately after one action potential, the membrane potential of these cells begins to depolarise again automatically, this is known as the pacemaker potential. Once the pacemaker potential reaches a set value, known as the threshold value, it then produces an action potential. Other cells within the heart (including the purkinje fibers and atrioventricular node; AVN) can also initiate action potentials; however, they do so at a slower rate and therefore, if the SA node is working, it usually beats the AVN to it.","question":"Where are the cells that control the resting heart rate found?","short_answers":["SA node","sinoatrial node"],"wikipage":"Sinoatrial node"}],"annotations":[{"knowledge":[],"long_answer":"The main role of a sinoatrial node cell, or SA node, is to initiate action potentials of the heart, so that it can pass throughout the heart and cause contraction.

This removes the constraint on the physical size of the embryonic mass and exposes the outer cells of the blastocyst to the interior of the uterus. Furthermore, hormonal changes in the mother, specifically a peak in luteinizing hormone (LH), prepare the endometrium to receive and envelop the blastocyst.

Melady was the last person to be publicly executed in Canada when he was hanged on December 7, 1869, on the outside wall of a jail located in Goderich, Ontario, for the murder of his father, Nicholas Melady Senior and his stepmother Ellen. The murders are believed to have been committed on the evening of June 6, 1868, on a farm in the present day municipality of Huron East, south of the current community of Seaforth, Ontario. Melady's trial was surrounded by controversy at the time, with allegations of perjury, lost and planted evidence, as well as the unusual use of a female police informant, who posed as a criminal and feigned affection for Melady while he was imprisoned, in an attempt to gain a confession from him. The informant, named in records as \"Jenny Smith\", was the wife of a local police officer. During the course of the investigation into the crime, seven other members of the Melady family, as well as two other male individuals, were initially jailed as suspects and later released. Melady's execution occurred several hours in advance of the officially announced time it was to occur in an attempt to avoid the civil disorder that sometimes accompanied public hangings. It is reported that a crowd of several thousand people were present at the jail at the originally announced time of the execution, many of whom are reported to have shouted their disapproval of the altered schedule of events.

{"question":"Where does diffusion occur in the excretory system?","answer":"The excretory system is a passive biological system that removes excess, unnecessary materials from the body fluids of an organism, so as to help maintain internal chemical homeostasis and prevent damage to the body. The kidneys remove from the blood the nitrogenous wastes such as urea, as well as salts and excess water, and excrete them in the form of urine. One of the main functions of the lungs is to diffuse gaseous wastes, such as carbon dioxide, from the bloodstream as a normal part of respiration. Invertebrates lack a liver, but most terrestrial groups, like insects, possesses a number of blind guts that serve the similar functions. Marine invertebrates do not need the ammonia conversion of the liver, as they can usually expel ammonia directly by diffusion through the skin. Most excretion of excess calcium is via the bile and feces, from the intestines, because the plasma calcitriol levels (which ultimately depend on the plasma calcium levels) regulate how much of the biliary calcium is reabsorbed from the intestinal contents.","qa_pairs":[{"context":"Invertebrates lack a liver, but most terrestrial groups, like insects, possesses a number of blind guts that serve the similar functions.

In August 1966, the Treasury Department discontinued production of the $2 and $5 denominations of United States Notes. While the $5 denomination had long been issued simultaneously as both a Federal Reserve Note and United States Note, the $2 denomination was not immediately reassigned to the Federal Reserve Note class of United States currency and was thus fully discontinued. The Treasury cited the two-dollar note's low use as the reason for not immediately resuming use of the denomination. In 1976, production of the two-dollar denomination was resumed and the two-dollar bill was finally assigned as a Federal Reserve Note, with a new reverse design featuring John Trumbull's depiction of the drafting of the United States Declaration of Independence replacing the previous design of Monticello. It has remained a current denomination since that time. It was estimated that if two-dollar notes replaced approximately half of the one-dollar notes in circulation, the federal government would be able to save about $26 million in 1976 dollars ($ adjusted for inflation) over the period from 1976 to 1981, due to reduced production, storage, and shipping costs.","question":"When was the last time a US $2 bill was printed before being resumed in 1976?","short_answers":["August 1966,"],"wikipage":"United States two-dollar bill"},{"context":"No context provided","question":"When was the last time a Canadian $2 note was printed?","short_answers":["February 18, 1996"],"wikipage":null}],"annotations":[{"knowledge":[],"long_answer":"In August 1966, the US $2 bill was discontinued and then in 1975 reintroduced.

New racial-discrimination laws were applied in 1802. The general was consequently dismissed from the army and became profoundly bitter toward Napoleon.

After a constitutional amendment was agreed to by all of the provinces, a reference to \"Unemployment Insurance\" was added to the matters falling under federal authority under the Constitution Act, 1867, and the first Canadian system was adopted in 1940.

{"question":"Who conducted the little albert study on conditioned fear?","answer":"The Little Albert experiment was a controlled experiment showing empirical evidence of classical conditioning in humans. The study also provides an example of stimulus generalization. It was carried out by John B. Watson and his graduate student, Rosalie Rayner, at Johns Hopkins University. After observing children in the field, Watson hypothesized that the fearful response of children to loud noises is an innate unconditioned response. He wanted to test the notion that by following the principles of the procedure now known as \"classical conditioning\", he could use this unconditioned response to condition a child to fear a distinctive stimulus that normally would not be feared by a child (in this case, furry objects).

It receives the most rainfall; more than annually in the far east. This is due to the gulf currents that carry humid air to the region, where it condenses and precipitates out in the vicinity of sea breeze fronts as well as when extratropical cyclones move by. While coastal sections see the most cloudy days statewide and year-round, northern sections see the most clear days during the summer. The wettest months of the year are April and May. The area is prone to severe thunderstorms and tornadoes when the proper conditions exist, generally in the springtime. Hurricanes also strike the region, the most disastrous of which was the Galveston Hurricane of 1900. More recently Hurricane Rita pummeled the Golden Triangle of southeast Texas. The higher humidity of the region amplifies the feeling of heat during the summer. During winter and spring along the immediate coast, temperatures are kept cool by relatively cool gulf waters. Dense advection fog can form when warm air moves over the cool shelf waters during February and March, stopping ship traffic for days.","question":"Where does it rain the most in the Piney Woods in texas?","short_answers":["the far east"],"wikipage":"Climate of Texas"}],"annotations":[{"knowledge":[{"content":"The Piney Woods is the eastern region of Texas and is within the humid subtropical climate zone.

An Order in Council of 24 October 1621 prohibited the Virginia colony to export tobacco and other commodities to foreign countries. The London Company lost its charter in 1624; the same year a proclamation, followed by Orders in Council, prohibited the use of foreign ships for the Virginia tobacco trade. These early companies held the monopoly on trade with their plantation; this meant that the commerce developed was to be England's. The Crown's purpose was to restrict to England the future commerce with America; it is well shown in the patent granted by Charles I to William Berkeley in 1639, by which the patentee was \"to oblige the masters of vessels, freighted with productions of the colony, to give bond before their departure to bring same into England ... and to forbid all trade with foreign vessels, except upon necessity.\"","question":"What order directed the flow of goods between england and the colonies, by banning Virginia from exporting to other countries?","short_answers":["Order in Council of 24 October 1621"],"wikipage":"Navigation Acts"},{"context":"As early as 1641 some English merchants urged that these rules be embodied in an act of Parliament, and during the Long Parliament, movement began in that direction.

Adam Anderson noted that this law also included \"security being given here, and certificates from thence, that the said goods be really exported thither, and for the only use of the said plantations\".

{"question":"Which of the animal is a carrier of h1n1?","answer":"In virology, influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (A\/H1N1) is a subtype of Influenza A virus. Well known outbreaks of H1N1 strains in humans include the 2009 swine flu pandemic, the 1977 Russian flu pandemic as well as the 1918 flu pandemic. The 1918 flu pandemic in humans was associated with H1N1 and influenza appearing in pigs; this may reflect a zoonosis either from swine to humans, or from humans to swine. Although it is not certain in which direction the virus was transferred, some evidence suggests, in this case, pigs caught the disease from humans. Although a recent phylogenetic analysis of more recent strains of H1N1 in humans, birds, animals, and many others and swine suggests the 1918 outbreak in humans followed a reassortment event within a mammal, the exact origin of the 1918 strain remains elusive.","qa_pairs":[{"context":"The 1918 flu pandemic in humans was associated with H1N1 and influenza appearing in pigs; this may reflect a zoonosis either from swine to humans, or from humans to swine.

The war put a Jeep on Japan's doorstep. The United States government ordered 100 vehicles with the then-new Willys specifications and tasked Toyota to manufacture them. The Toyota \"Jeep\" BJ prototype was developed in January 1951. This came from the demand for military-type utility vehicles, much like the British Land Rover Series 1 that was developed in 1948. The Jeep BJ was larger than the original U.S. Jeep and more powerful courtesy of its Type B 3.4-litre six-cylinder OHV Four-stroke petrol engine which generated a power output of at 3,600 rpm and torque at 1,600 rpm. It had a part-time four-wheel drive system like the Jeep. However, and unlike the Jeep, the Jeep BJ had no low-range transfer case. In July 1951, Toyota's test driver Ichiro Taira drove the next generation of the Jeep BJ prototype up to the sixth stage of Mount Fuji, the first vehicle to climb that height. The test was overseen by the National Police Agency (NPA). Impressed by this feat, the NPA quickly placed an order for 289 of these offroad vehicles, making the Jeep BJ their official patrol car.","question":"When was the Toyota \"Jeep\" BJ prototype, which became the Toyota Land Cruiser, made?","short_answers":["January 1951"],"wikipage":"Toyota Land Cruiser"},{"context":"No context provided","question":"When was the first prototype of what would become a Toyota Land Cruiser made?","short_answers":["1941"],"wikipage":null}],"annotations":[{"knowledge":[{"content":"The Toyota Land Cruiser (Japanese: \u30c8\u30e8\u30bf\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30af\u30eb\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc, Toyota Rando-Kur\u016bz\u0101) (also sometimes spelled as LandCruiser)[1] is a series of four-wheel drive vehicles produced by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota.

{"question":"When did the who play at the super bowl?","answer":"The Who performed at the halftime show during Super Bowl XLIV on February 7, 2010.","qa_pairs":[{"context":"During most of the Super Bowl's first decade, the halftime show featured a college marching band. The show's second decade featured a more varied show, often featuring drill teams and other performance ensembles; the group Up with People produced and starred in four of the performances. The middle of the third decade, in an effort to counter other networks' efforts to counterprogram the game, saw the introduction of popular music acts such as New Kids on the Block, Gloria Estefan, Michael Jackson, Clint Black, Patti LaBelle, and Tony Bennett. Starting with Super Bowl XXXII, commercial sponsors presented the halftime show; within five years, the tradition of having a theme\u2014begun with Super Bowl III\u2014ended, replaced by major music productions by arena rock bands and other high-profile acts. In the six years immediately following an incident at Super Bowl XXXVIII where Justin Timberlake exposed one of Janet Jackson's breasts in an alleged \"wardrobe malfunction\", all of the halftime shows consisted of a performance by one artist or group, with the musicians in that era primarily being rock artists from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. These shows were considered \"family friendly\" and the time in which they took place has been described as \"the age of reactionary halftime shows\".

This process starts with the mitotic division of the stem cells located close to the basement membrane of the tubules. These cells are called spermatogonial stem cells. The mitotic division of these produces two types of cells. Type A cells replenish the stem cells, and type B cells differentiate into primary spermatocytes. The primary spermatocyte divides meiotically (Meiosis I) into two primary spermatocytes; each secondary spermatocyte divides into two equal haploid spermatids by Meiosis II. The spermatids are transformed into spermatozoa(sperm) by the process of spermiogenesis. These develop into mature spermatozoa, also known as sperm cells.
