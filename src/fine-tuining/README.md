# Fine-Tuning Small Language Models (SLMs)

Fine-tuning SLMs is essential for adapting general-purpose models to specific use cases. This README provides a brief yet comprehensive overview of fine-tuning and its importance in AI consultancy, particularly focusing on generative AI applications like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and verticalized solutions. 

## **Why Fine-Tuning Matters**  
Fine-tuning enables the customization of LMs to improve performance on domain-specific tasks. Key use cases include:  
1. **Verticalization**: Tailoring models to specific industries, such as healthcare, finance, or Bharat-centric applications using Indic LLMs.  
2. **Enhanced Retrieval**: Fine-tuned models can optimize text embeddings for better RAG workflows.  
3. **Domain-Specific Queries**: Addressing tasks like English-to-SQL with schema injection, which has wide applicability in enterprise automation.

## **Challenges in Fine-Tuning**  
- **Computational Intensity**: Fine-tuning requires significant resources, often out of reach for individuals using laptops or limited hardware.  
- **Cost**: Leveraging paid models increases the financial barrier for PoC development.  
- **Complexity**: Achieving alignment between domain knowledge and model architecture is non-trivial.  

## **Strategies for Overcoming Challenges**  
1. **Utilize Pretrained Models**: Leverage community/open-source fine-tuned models available for vertical applications.  
2. **RAG-Based Solutions**: Combine retrieval systems with base LLMs to achieve domain relevance without full-scale fine-tuning.  

## **Projects**
0. **Develop PoCs**: Focus on RAG workflows using base models and evaluate the need for fine-tuning.  
1. **English-to-SQL**: With schema-aware adjustments, to master specific problem domains.
2. **Indic Language Adaptation**: Collaborate with local AI communities to fine-tune Indic LLMs for Bharat-centric use cases.  
3. **MidcurveNN**: Personal research with json data, a new potential publication
4. **Community Talks**: Use Google Gemma, Microsoft Phi for GDE, MVP talks respectively, Hugging Face for colleges/conferences

## **Future Direction**  
Fine-tuning and RAG workflows represent the IKIGAI of AI consultancy, offering immense potential for scalable, domain-specific solutions. With advances in Indic LLMs and lightweight techniques, fine-tuning will become increasingly accessible, driving innovation for both Bharat and global markets.
