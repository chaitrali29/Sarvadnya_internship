# Fine-Tuning Small Language Models (SLMs)

## Hugging Face `trl` vs `transformers`
In the context of fine-tuning, **Hugging Face's `transformers` library** and **Hugging Face's `trl` (transformers reinforcement learning)** have different purposes and methodologies. Here's a comparison:

---

### **1. Hugging Face `transformers`:**
- **Purpose:**
  - Focuses on traditional supervised fine-tuning of transformer models like BERT, GPT, T5, etc.
  - Supports transfer learning by adapting pre-trained models to new tasks using labeled datasets.
  
- **Key Features for Fine-Tuning:**
  - Standard training utilities such as `Trainer` and `TrainingArguments`.
  - Pre-built pipelines for tasks like classification, token classification, question answering, and more.
  - Supports various transformer architectures.
  - Custom loss functions and model architectures can be incorporated for fine-tuning.
  
- **Use Cases:**
  - Fine-tuning BERT for sentiment analysis.
  - Fine-tuning GPT-2 for text generation with a specific style.
  - Tuning T5 for summarization tasks.

- **Training Method:**
  - Requires labeled datasets for supervised training.
  - Loss is calculated based on task-specific objectives (e.g., cross-entropy loss for classification).

---

### **2. Hugging Face `trl`:**
- **Purpose:**
  - Designed for fine-tuning and optimizing language models using **reinforcement learning** (RL).
  - Extends `transformers` for advanced fine-tuning scenarios like **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**.

- **Key Features for Fine-Tuning:**
  - Implements algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
  - Focused on aligning language models with user-specific preferences or human feedback.
  - Can optimize models for objectives beyond standard supervised losses, like human-likeness or ethical behavior.
  
- **Use Cases:**
  - Fine-tuning GPT-like models to align with user feedback (e.g., OpenAI's ChatGPT-like fine-tuning).
  - Rewarding models for outputs that meet specific criteria, such as factual accuracy or politeness.
  - Domain-specific optimizations where traditional fine-tuning isn't sufficient.

- **Training Method:**
  - Uses a reward model to guide the training process, often incorporating human feedback.
  - Combines pre-trained transformer architectures with RL techniques like PPO.
  - Fine-tuning involves exploring and maximizing a reward function rather than relying solely on labeled datasets.

### **Key Differences:**

| Feature                        | Hugging Face `transformers`      | Hugging Face `trl`                      |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Approach**                   | Supervised Learning              | Reinforcement Learning                  |
| **Optimization Objective**     | Task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy) | Reward function (e.g., human feedback) |
| **Use Cases**                  | Standard NLP tasks               | Preference alignment, ethical tuning    |
| **Required Data**              | Labeled datasets                 | Feedback or reward signals              |
| **Training Algorithm**         | SGD, Adam, etc.                  | PPO, RL-specific optimizers             |

### **When to Use Which?**

- Use **`transformers`**:
  - If you have labeled datasets for standard tasks like classification, QA, or summarization.
  - For straightforward fine-tuning of pre-trained models.

- Use **`trl`**:
  - If your task involves preference alignment or optimization for subjective objectives.
  - When human feedback or complex reward functions are integral to the task.
  - For tasks requiring reinforcement learning algorithms.

Both libraries are complementary, and `trl` is often built on top of the `transformers` library, leveraging its pre-trained models. If you're working on advanced applications like conversational agents or personalized text generation, `trl` might be a better choice, while `transformers` suffices for general-purpose NLP tasks.

## English to SQL with Instruct Fine-Tuning
For instruction fine-tuning use cases like **English-to-SQL**, where paired examples of English sentences, corresponding SQL queries, and the SQL schema are available, **Hugging Face's `transformers` library** is generally the better choice. Here's why:

---

### **Why `transformers` is Better for English-to-SQL Fine-Tuning**

1. **Supervised Learning Approach:**
   - Instruction fine-tuning with paired data aligns directly with the supervised learning paradigm.
   - You can fine-tune a pre-trained model (e.g., T5, GPT) using the English-SQL pairs as input-output sequences.

2. **Sequence-to-Sequence Models:**
   - Models like **T5**, **BART**, and **GPT** are well-suited for sequence-to-sequence tasks.
   - They can effectively learn the mapping from natural language inputs to SQL outputs.

3. **Task-Specific Loss:**
   - The supervised objective (e.g., cross-entropy loss) ensures that the model learns to generate the exact SQL query corresponding to a given English instruction.
   - The SQL schema can be included in the input prompt to provide context for query generation.

4. **Ease of Fine-Tuning:**
   - The `transformers` library provides robust tools like the `Trainer` class, which simplifies fine-tuning with labeled data.
   - You can customize training arguments, model configurations, and evaluation metrics.

---

### **Why `trl` May Not Be the Best Fit**
1. **Reinforcement Learning Isn't Necessary:**
   - `trl` focuses on optimizing models using reward signals or human feedback, often for tasks where labeled datasets are limited or subjective goals exist.
   - In English-to-SQL, the pairs provide a direct supervision signal, making reinforcement learning an unnecessary overhead.

2. **Complexity:**
   - Setting up a reward model or defining a suitable reward function for SQL query generation is non-trivial.
   - Fine-tuning with `trl` requires more computational resources and expertise compared to `transformers`.

---

### **Optimal Approach for English-to-SQL Fine-Tuning**
1. **Model Choice:**
   - Use a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model like:
     - **T5**: Known for its versatility in text-to-text tasks.
     - **BART**: Another strong sequence-to-sequence model.
     - **Codex/OpenAI GPT Models**: Specialized for code and structured data generation.

2. **Fine-Tuning Strategy:**
   - Input Format: Include the SQL schema and English instruction as the input.
     Example:
     ```
     Input: "Translate to SQL. Instruction: Show all employees who joined after 2020. Schema: [employees(id, name, join_date)]"
     Output: "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE join_date > '2020-01-01';"
     ```
   - Train the model to map inputs to outputs using the paired dataset.

3. **Training Tools:**
   - Use Hugging Face `transformers` with `Trainer` and `TrainingArguments` for an efficient fine-tuning process.
   - Employ evaluation metrics like exact match (EM) and execution accuracy for SQL correctness.

---

### **Considerations for SQL-Schema Context**
If your use case demands that the model interpret complex schema relationships dynamically:
- Use **schema augmentation** techniques by including schema details in prompts.
- Fine-tune large models like Codex or GPT-4, which excel in generating structured queries.

---

### **Conclusion**
For an instruction fine-tuning use case like English-to-SQL with paired data:
- **Use Hugging Face `transformers`.**
- Focus on sequence-to-sequence models with schema-aware prompts for the best results.
