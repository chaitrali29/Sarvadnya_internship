Hence hermits, too, provide the king with\r\none-sixth of the grains gleaned by them, thinking that \u2018it is a tax\r\npayable to him who protects us.\u201d It is the king in whom the duties\r\nof both Indra (the rewarder) and Yama (the punisher) are blended,\r\nand he is a visible dispenser of punishments and rewards (heda-\r\nprasdda); whoever disregards kings will be visited with divine\r\npunishments, too. Hence kings shall never be despised.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus treacherous opponents of sovereignty shall be silenced.\r\n\r\nSpies shall also know the rumours prevalent in the state. Spies\r\nwith shaved heads or braided hair shall ascertain whether there\r\nprevails content or discontent among those who live upon the\r\ngrains, cattle, and gold of the king, among those who supply the\r\nsame (to the king) in weal or woe, those who keep under restraint a\r\ndisaffected relative of the king or a rebellious district, as well as\r\nthose who drive away an invading enemy or a wild tribe. The\r\ngreater the contentment of such persons, the more shall be the\r\nhonour shown to them; while those who are disaffected shall be\r\ningratiated by rewards or conciliation; or dissension may be sown\r\namong them so that they may alienate themselves from each other,\r\nfrom a neighbouring enemy, from a wild tribe, or from a banished\r\nor imprisoned prince. Failing this measure, they may be so\r\nemployed in collecting fines and taxes as to incur the displeasure of\r\nthe people. Those who are inebriated with feelings of enmity may\r\nbe put down by punishment in secret or by making them incur the\r\ndispleasure of the whole country. Or having taken the sons and\r\nwives of such treacherous persons under State protection, they may\r\nbe made to live in mines, lest they may afford shelter to enemies.\r\n\r\nThose that are angry, those that are greedy, those that are\r\nalarmed, as well as those that despise the king are the instruments\r\n\r\n32\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nof enemies. Spies under the guise of astrologers and tellers of\r\nomens and augury shall ascertain the relationship of such persons\r\nwith each other and with foreign kings.\r\n\r\nHonours and rewards shall be conferred upon those that are\r\ncontented, while those that are disaffected shall be brought round\r\nby conciliation, by gifts, or by sowing dissension, or by\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nThus in his own state a wise king shall guard factions among\r\nhis people, friendly or hostile, powerful or powerless against the\r\nintrigue of foreign kings.\r\n\r\n[Thus ends Chapter XIII, \u201cProtection of Parties for or against One's\r\nOwn Cause in One's Own State,\u201d in Book I, \u201cConcerning\r\nDiscipline\u201d of the Arthasdstra of Kautilya.]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.

This is a serious\r\ndefect. Hence he shall consult such persons as are believed to be\r\ncapable of giving decisive opinion regarding those works about\r\nwhich he seeks for advice. If he consults thus, he can secure good\r\nadvice as well as secrecy of counsel.\u201d\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" says Kautilya, \"for this (kind of seeking for advice)\r\nis infinite and endless.

The word is of\r\n\r\nfour kinds\u2014nouns, verbs, prefixes of verbs, and particles (nipdta).\r\n\r\nA noun is that which signifies an essence (sarva).\r\nA verb is that which has no definite gender and signifies an\r\naction.\r\n'Pra\u2019 and other words are the prefixes of verbs.\r\n'Cha\u2019 and other indeclinable words are particles.\r\nA group of words conveying a complete sense is a sentence\r\n(vdkya).\r\nCombination of words (varga) consisting of not more than\r\n\r\nthree words and not less than one word shall be so formed as to\r\nharmonise with the meaning of immediately following words.\r\n\r\n96\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nThe word, \u201cif,\u201d is used to indicate the completion of a writ;\r\nand also to indicate an oral message as in the phrase\r\n\u2018vachikamasyeti,\u201d an oral message along with this (writ).\r\n\r\nCalumniation (nindd), commendation, inquiry, narration\r\nrequest, refusal, censure, prohibition, command, conciliation,\r\npromise of help, threat, and persuasion are the thirteen purposes for\r\nwhich writs are issued.\r\n\r\nCalumniation (nindd) consists in speaking ill of one's family,\r\nbody and acts.\r\nCommendation (prasamsd) consists in praising one's family,\r\nperson, and acts.\r\n\r\nTo inquire \"how is this?\" is inquiry.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 147076, "end_char_idx": 151231, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbbac6fe-0bf8-42d8-ab00-cb83a6e9d0ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbbac6fe-0bf8-42d8-ab00-cb83a6e9d0ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3915e6e8-e194-4063-81ce-69b23b1fd1d5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "9aeee4a77583954b7b7fd120367a0e4e148bf4fa920eea51255022ae22e7c967", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b31fd07f-959a-4122-acc1-79bc0eb1063a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "531266a4f651cb1e44d24b5bfe27fd263c4125d5da64db1bac401b9ea72938b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Combination of words (varga) consisting of not more than\r\n\r\nthree words and not less than one word shall be so formed as to\r\nharmonise with the meaning of immediately following words.\r\n\r\n96\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nThe word, \u201cif,\u201d is used to indicate the completion of a writ;\r\nand also to indicate an oral message as in the phrase\r\n\u2018vachikamasyeti,\u201d an oral message along with this (writ).\r\n\r\nCalumniation (nindd), commendation, inquiry, narration\r\nrequest, refusal, censure, prohibition, command, conciliation,\r\npromise of help, threat, and persuasion are the thirteen purposes for\r\nwhich writs are issued.\r\n\r\nCalumniation (nindd) consists in speaking ill of one's family,\r\nbody and acts.\r\nCommendation (prasamsd) consists in praising one's family,\r\nperson, and acts.\r\n\r\nTo inquire \"how is this?\" is inquiry.\r\n\r\nTo point out the way as 'thus,\u2019 is narration (dkhydna).\r\n\r\nTo entreat as 'give,\u2019 is request.\r\n\r\nTo say that 'T do not give,\u2019 is refusal.\r\n\r\nTo say that 'it is not worthy of thee,\u2019 is censure (updlambhah).\r\n\r\nTo say as 'do not do so,\u2019 is prohibition (pratishedha).\r\n\r\nTo say that 'this should be done,\u2019 is command (ch\u00e9dand).\r\n\r\nTo say 'what I am, thou art that;\r\nwhichever article is mine is thine also, is\r\nconciliation (sdntvam).

Pointing out the evil\r\n\r\nconsequences that may occur in future is\r\n\r\nthreat (abhibartsanam). Persuasion is of\r\n\r\nthree kinds: that made for the purpose of\r\n\r\nmoney, that made in case of one's failure\r\n\r\nto fulfill a promise, and that made on\r\n\r\noccasion of any trouble. Also writs of\r\n\r\ninformation, of command, and of gift;\r\n\r\nlikewise writs of remission, of licence, of\r\n\r\nguidance, of reply, and of general\r\n\r\nproclamation are other varieties.\r\n\r\nThus says (the messenger); so says (the king); if there is any\r\n\r\ntruth in this (statement of the messenger), then the thing (agreed to)\r\nshould at once be surrendered; (the messenger) has informed the\r\n\r\nking of all the deeds of the enemy. (Parakdra);\u2014this is the writ of\r\ninformation which is held to be of various forms.\r\n\r\nWherever and especially regarding Government servants the\r\nking's order either for punishment or for rewards is issued, it is\r\ncalled writ of command (djndl\u00e9kha).\r\n\r\nWhere the bestowal of honour for deserving merit is\r\ncontemplated either as help to alleviate affliction (ddhi) or as gift\r\n(pariddna), there are issued writs of gift (upagrahalekha).\r\n\r\nWhatever favour (anugraha) to special castes, cities, villages,\r\nor countries of various description is announced in obedience to the\r\n\r\n98\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nking's order, it is called writ of remission (parihdral\u00e9kha) by those\r\nwho know it.\r\n\r\nLikewise licence or permission (nisrishti) shall be enjoined\r\neither in word or deed;

TRAINING OF ELEPHANTS.\r\n\r\nELEPHANTS are classified into four kinds in accordance\r\nwith the training they are given: that which is tameable (damya),\r\nthat which is trained for war (sdnndhya), that which is trained for\r\nriding (aupavdhya), and rogue elephants (vydla).\r\n\r\nThose which are tameable fall under five groups: that which\r\nsuffers a man to sit on its withers (skandhagata), that which allows\r\nitself to be tethered to a post (stambhagata), that which can be\r\ntaken to water (vdrigata), that which lies in pits (apapdtagata), and\r\nthat which is attached to its herd (yithagata).\r\n\r\nAll these elephants shall be treated with as much care as a\r\nyoung elephant (bikka).\r\n\r\nMilitary training is of seven kinds: Drill (upasthdna), turning\r\n(samvartana), advancing (samydna), trampling down and killing\r\n(vadhdvadha), fighting with other elephants (hastiyuddha),\r\nassailing forts and cities (ndgardyanam), and warfare.\r\n\r\nBinding the elephants with girths (kakshydkarma), putting\r\non collars (graiveyakakarma), and making them work in company\r\nwith their herds (yidthakarma) are the first steps (upa-vichara) of\r\nthe above training.\r\n\r\nElephants trained for riding fall under seven groups: that\r\nwhich suffers a man to mount over it when in company with\r\nanother elephant (kunjaropavdhya), that which suffers riding when\r\nled by a warlike elephant (sdnndhyopavdhya), that which is taught\r\ntrotting (dhorana), that which is taught various kinds of\r\nmovements (ddhdnagatika), that which can be made to move by\r\nusing a staff (yashtyupavdhya), that which can be made to move by\r\nusing an iron hook (totropavdhya), that which can be made to\r\nmove without whips (suddhopavdhya), and that which is of help in\r\n\r\n197\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nhunting.\r\n\r\nAutumnal work (sdradakarma), mean or rough work\r\n(hinakarma), and training to respond to signals are the first steps\r\nfor the above training.\r\n\r\nRogue elephants can be trained only in one way. The only\r\nmeans to keep them under control is punishment. It has a\r\nsuspicious aversion to work, is obstinate, of perverse nature,\r\nunsteady, willful, or of infatuated temper under the influence of\r\nrut.\r\n\r\nRogue elephants whose training proves a failure may be\r\npurely roguish (suddha), clever in roguery (suvrata), perverse\r\n(vishama), or possessed of all kinds of vice.\r\n\r\nThe form of fetters and other necessary means to keep them\r\nunder control shall be ascertained from the doctor of elephants.\r\n\r\nTetherposts (dldna), collars, girths, bridles, legchains, frontal\r\nfetters are the several kinds of binding instruments.\r\n\r\nA hook, a bamboo staff, and machines (yantra) are\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nNecklaces such as vaijavanti and kshurapramdla, and litter\r\nand housings are the ornaments of elephants.\r\n\r\nMail-armour (varma), clubs (totra), arrow-bags, and\r\nmachines are war-accoutrements.\r\n\r\nElephant doctors, trainers, expert riders, as well as those who\r\ngroom them, those who prepare their food, those who procure grass\r\nfor them, those who tether them to posts, those who sweep elephant\r\n\r\n198\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nstables, and those who keep watch in the stables at night, are some\r\nof the persons that have to attend to the needs of elephants.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 299127, "end_char_idx": 302814, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f947b39-b8dd-4a5e-b076-cbea79c7f5d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f947b39-b8dd-4a5e-b076-cbea79c7f5d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "06883de2-10a3-4572-a2f9-7ec65cbf01fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "0fc1d0be6549798c28378497b41faa81dcd18b175580b3bf26dd227baf9461ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6666e958-b856-4847-90e7-5f329b18d3a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e98e77a95cd7ea12f5af2e876ae5caa90596146ae92f75633bc02b8ff1c4832", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Tetherposts (dldna), collars, girths, bridles, legchains, frontal\r\nfetters are the several kinds of binding instruments.\r\n\r\nA hook, a bamboo staff, and machines (yantra) are\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nNecklaces such as vaijavanti and kshurapramdla, and litter\r\nand housings are the ornaments of elephants.\r\n\r\nMail-armour (varma), clubs (totra), arrow-bags, and\r\nmachines are war-accoutrements.\r\n\r\nElephant doctors, trainers, expert riders, as well as those who\r\ngroom them, those who prepare their food, those who procure grass\r\nfor them, those who tether them to posts, those who sweep elephant\r\n\r\n198\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nstables, and those who keep watch in the stables at night, are some\r\nof the persons that have to attend to the needs of elephants.\r\n\r\nElephant doctors, watchmen, sweepers, cooks and others\r\nshall receive (from the storehouse,) 1 prastha of cooked rice, a\r\nhandful of oil, land 2 palas of sugar and of salt.

The joint-performance of sacred duties (by a\r\nman and a woman) is known as prdjdpatya marriage.\r\n\r\n(The giving in marriage of a maiden) for a couple of cows is\r\ncalled Arsha. (The giving in marriage of a maiden) to an officiating\r\npriest in a sacrifice is called Daiva. The voluntary union of a\r\nmaiden with her lover is called Gdndharva. Giving a maiden after\r\nreceiving plenty of wealth (silka) is termed Asura. The abduction\r\nof a maiden is called Rdkshasa. The abduction of a maiden while\r\nshe is asleep and in intoxication is called Paisdcha marraige.\r\n\r\nOf these, the first four are ancestral customs of old and are\r\nvalid on their being approved of by the father. The rest are to be\r\nsanctioned by both the father and the mother; for it is they that\r\nreceive the money (silka) paid by the bridegroom for their\r\ndaughter. In case of the absence by death of either the father or the\r\nmother, the survivor will receive the silka. If both of them are\r\ndead, the maiden herself shall receive it. Any kind of marriage is\r\napprovable, provided it pleases all those (that are concerned in it.)\r\n\r\n(Property of Women.)\r\n\r\nMeans of subsistence (vritti) or jewellery (dbadhya)\r\nconstitutes what is called the property of a woman. Means of\r\nsubsistence valued at above two thousand shall be endowed (on her\r\nname). There is no limit to jewellery. It is no guilt for the wife to\r\nmake use of this property in maintaining her son, her\r\ndaughter-in-law or herself whenever her absent husband has made\r\nno provision for her maintenance. In calamities, disease and\r\nfamine, in warding off dangers and in charitable acts, the husband,\r\ntoo, may make use of this property. Neither shall there be any\r\ncomplaint against the enjoyment of this property by mutual\r\n\r\n219\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nconsent by a couple who have brought forth a twin. Nor shall there\r\nbe any complaint if this property has been enjoyed for three years\r\nby those who are wedded in accordance with the customs of the\r\nfirst four kinds of marriage. But the enjoyment of this property in\r\nthe cases of Gdndharva and Asura marriages shall be liable to be\r\nrestored together with interest on it. In the case of such marriages\r\nas are called Rdkshasa and Paisacha, the use of this property shall\r\nbe dealt with as theft. Thus the duty of marriage is dealt with.\r\n\r\nOn the death of her husband a woman, desirous to lead a pious\r\nlife, shall at once receive not only her endowment and jewellery\r\n(sthdpydbharanam), but also the balance of silka due to her. If\r\nboth of these two things are not actually in her possession, though\r\nnominally given to her, she shall at once receive both of them\r\ntogether with interest (on their value.)

If a\r\nwoman, under the apprehension of danger from her husband,\r\ndesires divorce, she shall forfeit her claim to her property;\r\nmarriages contracted in accordance with the customs of the first\r\nfour kinds of marriages cannot be dissolved.\r\n\r\n(Transgression.)\r\n\r\nIf a woman engages herself in amorous sports, or drinking in\r\nthe face of an order to the contrary, she shall be fined 3 panas. She\r\nshall pay a fine of 6 panas for going out at day time to sports or to\r\nsee a woman or spectacles. She shall pay a fine of 12 panas if she\r\n\r\n224\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\ngoes out to see another man or for sports. For the same offences\r\ncommitted at night, the fines shall be doubled. If a woman abducts\r\nanother woman while the latter is asleep or under intoxication\r\n(suptamatta-pravrajane), or if she drags her husband as far as the\r\ndoor of the house, she shall be fined 12 panas. If a woman leaves\r\nher house at night, she shall pay double the above fine. If a man and\r\na woman make signs to each other with a view to sensual\r\nenjoyment, or carry on secret conversation (for the same purpose),\r\nthe woman shall pay a fine of 24 panas, and the man, double the\r\namount. A woman, holding out her hair, the tie of her dress round\r\nher loins, her teeth or her nails, shall pay the first amercement, and\r\na man, doing the same, twice the first amercement.\r\n\r\nFor holding conversation in suspicious places, whips may be\r\nsubstituted for fines. In the centre of the village, an outcaste person\r\n(chanddla) may whip such women five times on each of the sides\r\nof their body. She may get rid of being whipped by paying a pana\r\nfor each whip (panikam vd praharam mokshayet). Thus\r\ntransgression is dealt with.\r\n\r\n(Forbidden transactions.)\r\n\r\nWith regard to a man and a woman who, though forbidden to\r\ncarry on any mutual transaction, help each other, the woman shall\r\nbe fined 12, 24 and 54 panas respectively according as the help\r\nconsists of (i) small things, of (ii) heavy things and (iii) of gold or\r\ngold-coin (hiranyasuvarnayoh); and the man, at double the above\r\nrates. With regard to similar transaction between a man and a\r\nwoman who cannot mix with each other (agamvayoh), half of the\r\nabove punishment shall be levied.

Accurate description of\r\nthe exact boundaries of fields, gardens, buildings of any kind, lakes\r\nor tanks shall be declared before the elders of the village or of the\r\nneighbourhood. If, on crying aloud thrice \u201cWho will purchase this\r\nat such and such a price\u2019? no opposition is offered, the purchaser\r\nmay proceed to purchase the holding in question. If at this time the\r\nvalue of the property is increased by bidding even among persons\r\nof the same community, the increased amount together with the toll\r\non the value shall be handed over into the king's treasury. The\r\nbidder (vikrayapratikroshtd) shall pay the toll. Bidding for a\r\n\r\n241\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nproperty in the absence of its owner shall be punished with a fine of\r\n24 panas. If the owner does not come forward even on the\r\nexpiration of seven nights, the bidder may take possession of the\r\nproperty. Sale of building, etc., (vdstu) to other than the bidder\r\nshall be punished with a fine of 200 panas; if the property is other\r\nthan buildings, etc., (vdstu), the fine for the above offence shall be\r\n24 panas.

If the boundary marks just described are not found, a\r\nfine of 1,000 panas shall be imposed (on the misleading or guilty\r\nperson). If, however, they arrive at the exact spot, the party who\r\nhave either encroached upon the boundary or have destroyed the\r\nboundary marks shall be similarly punished.\r\n\r\nThe king shall beneficially distribute among others those\r\nholdings which have no boundary-marks or which have ceased to\r\nbe enjoyed by any person.\r\n\r\n(Disputes about fields.)\r\n\r\nDisputes concerning fields shall be decided by the elders of\r\nthe neighbourbood or of the village.

The answers\r\nobtained shall be compared with the defendant's own statements\r\nregarding the same. Then the defendant shall be asked as to not\r\nonly the nature of the work he did during the day previous to the\r\ntheft, but also the place where he spent the night till he was caught\r\nhold of. If his answers for these questions are attested to by reliable\r\nreferees or witnesses, he shall be acquitted. Otherwise he shall be\r\nsubjected torture (anyatha karmaprdptah).\r\n\r\nThree days after the commission of a crime, no suspected\r\nperson (sankitakah) shall be arrested inasmuch as there is no room\r\nfor questions unless there is strong evidence to bring home the\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nPersons who charge an innocent man with theft, or conceal a\r\nthief shall themselves be liable to the punishment for theft.\r\n\r\nWhen a person accused of theft proves in his defence the\r\ncomplainant's enmity or hatred towards himself he shall be\r\nacquitted.\r\n\r\nAny person who keeps an innocent man in confinement\r\n(parivdsayatah suddham) shall be punished with the first\r\namercement.\r\n\r\nGuilt against a suspected person shall be established by the\r\nproduction of such evidences as the instruments made use of by the\r\naccused, his accomplices or abettors, the stolen article, and any\r\n\r\n312\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nmiddlemen involved in selling or purchasing the stolen article.

REPLENISHMENT OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\nTHE king who finds himself in a great financial trouble and\r\nneeds money, may collect (revenue by demand). In such parts of\r\nhis country as depend solely upon rain for water and are rich in\r\ngrain, he may demand of his subjects one-third or one-fourth of\r\ntheir grain according to their capacity. He shall never demand of\r\nsuch of his subjects as live in tracts of middle or low quality; nor of\r\npeople who are of great help in the construction of fortifications,\r\n\r\n341\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\ngardens, buildings, roads for traffic, colonisation of waste lands,\r\nexploitation of mines, and formation of forest-preserves for timber\r\nand, elephants; nor of people who live on the border of his\r\nkingdom or who have not enough subsistence. He shall, on the\r\nother hand, supply with grain and cattle those who colonise waste\r\nlands. He may purchase for gold one-fourth of what remains, after\r\ndeducting as much of the grain as is required for seeds and\r\nsubsistence of his subjects. He shall avoid the property of forest\r\ntribes, as well as of Brdhmans learned in the Vedas (srotriya). He\r\nmay purchase this, too, offering favourable price (to the owners).\r\nFailing these measures, the servants of the collector-general may\r\nprevail upon the peasantry to raise summer crops. Saying that\r\ndouble the amount of fines will be levied from those who are guilty\r\n(among peasants), they (the king's employees) shall sow seeds in\r\nsowing seasons. When crops are ripe, they may beg a portion of\r\nvegetable and other ripe produce except what is gleaned in the\r\nform of vegetables and grains.

He should look to the bodily\r\ncomforts of his servants by providing such emoluments as can\r\ninfuse in them the spirit of enthusiasm to work. He should not\r\nviolate the course of righteousness and wealth.\r\n\r\nThe sacrificial priest (ritvig), the teacher, the minister, the\r\npriest (purohita), the commander of the army, the heir-apparent\r\nprince, the mother of the king, and the queen shall (each receive)\r\n48,000 (panas per annum). With this amount of subsistence, they\r\nwill scarcely yield themselves to temptation and hardly be\r\ndiscontented.\r\n\r\nThe door-keeper, the superintendent of the harem\r\n(antarvamsika) the commander (prasdstri), the collector-general,\r\nand the chamberlain, 24,000. With this amount they become\r\nserviceable.\r\n\r\nThe prince (kumdra), the nurse of the prince, the chief\r\nconstable (ndyaka), the officer in charge of the town (paura) the\r\nsuperintendent of law or commerce (vydvahdrika), the\r\nsuperintendent of manufactories (karmdntika), members of the\r\ncouncil of ministers, the superintendents of country parts and of\r\nboundaries, 12,000. With this they will be loyal and powerful\r\nsupporters of the king's cause.\r\n\r\n348\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nThe chiefs of military corporations, the chiefs of elephants, of\r\nhorses, of chariots and of infantry and commissioners\r\n(pradeshtdrah), 8,000. With this amount they can have a good\r\nfollowing in their own communities.\r\n\r\nThe Superintendents of infantry, of cavalry, of chariots and of\r\nelephants, the guards of timber and elephant forests, 4,000.\r\n\r\nThe chariot-driver, the physician of the army, the trainer of\r\nhorses, the carpenter, (vardhaki), and those who rear animals\r\n(yoniposhaka), 2,000.\r\n\r\nThe foreteller, the reader of omens, the astrologer, the reader\r\nof Purdnas, the storyteller, the bard (mdgadha), the retinue of the\r\npriest, and all superintendents of departments, 1,000.\r\n\r\nTrained soldiers, the staff of accountants and writers, 500.\r\n\r\nMusicians (kusilava), 250. Of these, the trumpet-blowers\r\n(tiiryakara) shall get twice as much wages as others. Artisans and\r\ncarpenters, 120.\r\n\r\nServants in charge of quadrupeds and bipeds, workmen doing\r\nmiscellaneous work, attendants upon the royal person,\r\nbody-guards, and the procurer of free labourers shall receive a\r\nsalary of 60 panas.\r\n\r\nThe honourable play-mate of the king (dryayukta), the\r\nelephant-driver, the sorcerer (manavaka), miners of mountains\r\n(sailakhanaka), all kinds of attendants, teachers, and learned men\r\nshall have honorarium ranging from 500 to 1,000 (panas)\r\naccording to their merit.\r\n\r\nA messenger of middle quality shall receive 10 panas for\r\n\r\n349\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\neach yojana he travels; and twice as much when he travels from 10\r\nto 100 yojanas.\r\n\r\nWhoever represents the king in the rdjasiya and other\r\nsacrifices shall get three times as much as is paid to others who are\r\nequal to him in learning; and the charioteer of the king (in the\r\nsacrifices), 1,000.\r\n\r\nSpies such as the fradulent (kdpatika), the indifferent\r\n(uddsthita), the house-holder, the merchant, and the ascetic 1,000.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 551538, "end_char_idx": 555200, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11549dc0-435d-4114-b16a-4a46a9e6497e": {"__data__": {"id_": "11549dc0-435d-4114-b16a-4a46a9e6497e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "61f7a6d4-14ea-4edf-9fc9-35e01e2c0a2f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "c2ded050a228c74ec0642b384e61f7b16b6a3df8cbf9b14372cfb6eba4c1a921", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bab8ca05-d0d8-45e3-8066-402e73557892", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "07b1cc481cdc6426d6c5d0ff05a9cfa7a68cb0d8fdb3eca5a708fd8e57657124", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A messenger of middle quality shall receive 10 panas for\r\n\r\n349\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\neach yojana he travels; and twice as much when he travels from 10\r\nto 100 yojanas.\r\n\r\nWhoever represents the king in the rdjasiya and other\r\nsacrifices shall get three times as much as is paid to others who are\r\nequal to him in learning; and the charioteer of the king (in the\r\nsacrifices), 1,000.\r\n\r\nSpies such as the fradulent (kdpatika), the indifferent\r\n(uddsthita), the house-holder, the merchant, and the ascetic 1,000.\r\n\r\nThe village-servant (grdmabhritaka), fiery spies, poisoners\r\nand mendicant women, 500 (panas).\r\n\r\nServants leading the spies, 250 or in proportion to the work\r\ndone by them.\r\n\r\nSuperintendents of a hundred or a thousand coinmunities\r\n(varga) shall regulate the subsistence, wages, profits, appointinent,\r\nand transference (vikshepa), of the men under them.\r\n\r\nThere shall be no transference of officers employed to guard\r\nthe royal buildings, forts, and country parts.

THE ELEMENTS OF SOVEREIGNTY.\r\n\r\nTHE king, the minister, the country, the fort, the treasury, the\r\narmy and the friend are the elements of sovereignty.\r\n\r\nOf these, the best qualities of the king are:--\r\n\r\nBorn of a high family, godly, possessed of valour, seeing\r\nthrough the medium of aged persons, virtuous, truthful, not of a\r\ncontradictory nature, grateful, having large aims, highly\r\nenthusiastic, not addicted to procrastination, powerful to control\r\nhis neighbouring kings, of resolute mind, having an assembly of\r\nministers of no mean quality, and possessed of a taste for\r\ndiscipline;--these are the qualities of an inviting nature.\r\n\r\nInquiry, hearing, perception, retention in memory, reflection,\r\ndeliberation, inference and steadfast adherence to conclusions are\r\nthe qualities of the intellect.\r\n\r\nValour, determination of purpose, quickness, and probity are\r\nthe aspects of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nPossessed of a sharp intellect, strong memory, and keen\r\nmind, energetic, powerful, trained in all kinds of arts, free from\r\nvice, capable of paying in the same coin by way of awarding\r\npunishments or rewards, possessed of dignity, capable of taking\r\nremedial measures against dangers, possessed of foresight, ready\r\nto avail himself of opportunities when afforded in respect of place,\r\n\r\n362\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\ntime, and manly efforts, clever enough to discern the causes\r\nnecessitating the cessation of treaty or war with an enemy, or to lie\r\nin wait keeping treaties, obligations and pledges, or to avail himself\r\nof his enemy's weak points, making jokes with no loss of dignity or\r\nsecrecy, never brow-beating and casting haughty and stern looks,\r\nfree from passion, anger, greed, obstinacy, fickleness, haste and\r\nback-biting habits, talking to others with a smiling face, and\r\nobserving customs as taught by aged persons;--such is the nature of\r\nself-possession.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications of a minister have been described in the\r\nbeginning, middle, and at the close of the work.\r\n\r\nPossessed of capital cities both in the centre and the\r\nextremities of the kingdom, productive of subsistence not only to\r\nits own people, but also to outsiders on occasions of calamities,\r\nrepulsive to enemies, powerful enough to put down neighbouring\r\nkings, free from miry, rocky, uneven, and desert tracts as well as\r\nfrom conspirators, tigers, wild beasts, and large tracts of\r\nwilderness, beautiful to look at, containing fertile lands, mines,\r\ntimber and elephant forests, and pasture grounds, artistic,\r\ncontaining hidden passages, full of cattle, not depending upon rain\r\nfor water, possessed of land and waterways, rich in various kinds\r\nof commercial articles, capable of bearing the burden of a vast\r\narmy and heavy taxation, inhabited by agriculturists of good and\r\nactive character, full of intelligent masters and servants, and with a\r\npopulation noted for its loyalty and good character;--these are the\r\nqualities of a good country.\r\n\r\nThe excellent qualities of forts have already been described.\r\n\r\nJustly obtained either by inheritance or by self-acquisition,\r\nrich in gold and silver, filled with an abundance of big gems of\r\n\r\n363\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nvarious colours and of gold coins, and capable to withstand\r\ncalamities of long duration is the best treasury.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 574099,

CONCERNING PEACE AND EXERTION.\r\n\r\nACQUISITION and security (of property) are dependent\r\nupon peace and industry.\r\n\r\nEfforts to achieve the results of works undertaken is industry\r\n(vydydma).\r\n\r\nAbsence of disturbance to the enjoyment of the results\r\nachieved from works is peace.\r\n\r\nThe application of the six-fold royal policy is the source of\r\npeace and industry.\r\n\r\nDeterioration, stagnation, and progress are the three aspects\r\nof position.\r\n\r\nThose causes of human make which affect position are policy\r\nand impolicy (raya and apanaya); fortune and misfortune (aya and\r\nanaya) are providential causes. Causes, both human and\r\nprovidential, govern the world and its affairs.\r\n\r\n365\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nWhat is unforeseen is providential; here, the attainment of\r\nthat desired end which seemed almost lost is (termed) fortune.\r\n\r\nWhat is anticipated is human; and the attainment of a desired\r\nend as anticipated is (due to policy).\r\n\r\nWhat produces unfavourable results is impolicy. This can be\r\nforeseen; but misfortune due to providence cannot be known.\r\n\r\nThe king who, being possessed of good character and\r\nbest-fitted elements of sovereignty, is the fountain of policy, is\r\ntermed the conqueror.\r\n\r\nThe king who is situated anywhere immediately on the\r\ncircumference of the conqueror\u2019s territory is termed the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe king who is likewise situated close to the enemy, but\r\nseparated from the conqueror only by the enemy, is termed the\r\nfriend (of the conqueror).\r\n\r\nA neighbouring foe of considerable power is styled an\r\nenemy; and when he is involved in calamities or has taken himself\r\nto evil ways, he becomes assailable; and when he has little or no\r\nhelp, he becomes destructible; otherwise (i.e., when he is provided\r\nwith some help), he deserves to be harassed or reduced.

As each of these three\r\nkings possesses the five elements of sovereignty, such as the\r\nminister, the country, the fort, the treasury, and the army, a circle of\r\nstates consists of eighteen elements. Thus, it needs no commentary\r\nto understand that the (three) Circles of States having the enemy\r\n(of the conqueror), the Madhyama king, or the neutral king at the\r\ncentre of each of the three circles, are different from that of the\r\nconqueror. Thus there are four primary Circles of States, twelve\r\n\r\n367\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nkings, sixty elements of sovereignty, and seventy-two elements of\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nEach of the twelve primary kings shall have their elements of\r\nsovereignty, power, and end.

End of the\r\nninety-ninth chapter from the beginning.]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. THE NATURE OF ALLIANCE.\r\n\r\nWHEN the advantages derivable from peace and war are of\r\nequal character, one should prefer peace; for disadvantages, such\r\nas the loss of power and wealth, sojourning, and sin, are\r\never-attending upon war.\r\n\r\nThe same holds good in the case of neutrality and war. Of the\r\ntwo (forms of policy), double policy and alliance, double policy\r\n\r\n374\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\n(i.e., making peace with one and waging war with another) is\r\npreferable; for whoever adopts the double policy enriches himself,\r\nbeing ever attentive to his own works, whereas an allied king has to\r\nhelp his ally at his own expense.\r\n\r\nOne shall make an alliance with a king who is stronger than\r\none's neighbouring enemy; in the absence of such a king, one\r\nshould ingratiate oneself with one's neighbouring enemy, either by\r\nsupplying money or army or by ceding a part of one's territory and\r\nby keeping oneself aloof; for there can be no greater evil to kings\r\nthan alliance with a king of considerable power, unless one is\r\nactually attacked by one's enemy.\r\n\r\nA powerless king should behave as a conquered king\r\n(towards his immediate enemy); but when he finds that the time of\r\nhis own ascendancy is at hand due to a fatal disease, internal\r\ntroubles, increase of enemies, or a friend's calamities that are\r\nvexing his enemy, then under the pretence of performing some\r\nexpiatory rites to avert the danger of his enemy, he may get out (of\r\nthe enemy's court); or if he is in his own territory, he should not go\r\nto see his suffering enemy; or if he is near to his enemy, he may\r\nmurder the enemy when opportunity affords itself.\r\n\r\nA king who is situated between two powerful kings shall seek\r\nprotection from the stronger of the two; or from one of them on\r\nwhom he can rely; or he may make peace with both of them on\r\nequal terms. Then he may begin to set one of them against the other\r\nby telling each that the other is a tyrant causing utter ruin to\r\nhimself, and thus cause dissension between them. When they are\r\ndivided, he may pat down each separately by secret or covert\r\nmeans. Or, throwing himself under the protection of any two\r\nimmediate kings of considerable power, he may defend himself\r\nagainst an immediate enemy. Or, having made an alliance with a\r\nchief in a stronghold, he may adopt double policy (i.e., make peace\r\n\r\n375\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nwith one of the two kings, and wage war with another). Or, be may\r\nadapt himself to circumstances depending upon the causes of peace\r\nand war in order. Or, he may make friendship with traitors,\r\nenemies, and wild chiefs who are conspiring against both the kings.\r\nOr, pretending to be a close friend of one of them, he may strike the\r\nother at the latter's weak point by employing enemies, and wild\r\ntribes.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 592890, "end_char_idx": 596953, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4cc95a39-80ca-40d2-b4f2-19979899d1f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4cc95a39-80ca-40d2-b4f2-19979899d1f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3067134-ce91-482c-991b-d57dfe6a1066", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "137573d70e774074e130ff8b37d4d24b4e66422292ec295c3e031d0b953f3a2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d26d7e4-c431-4e35-a84e-4bcadb978bd1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "307eb1720906e5f4fdf4ab0486282160f735e8cc9bfe3bbf42a5350a6cea851d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "When they are\r\ndivided, he may pat down each separately by secret or covert\r\nmeans.

Or, be may\r\nadapt himself to circumstances depending upon the causes of peace\r\nand war in order. Or, he may make friendship with traitors,\r\nenemies, and wild chiefs who are conspiring against both the kings.\r\nOr, pretending to be a close friend of one of them, he may strike the\r\nother at the latter's weak point by employing enemies, and wild\r\ntribes. Or, having made friendship with both, he may form a Circle\r\nof States. Or, he may make an alliance with the madhyama or the\r\nneutral king; and with this help he may put down one of them or\r\nboth. Or when hurt by both, he may seek protection from a king of\r\nrighteous character among the madhyama king, the neutral king,\r\nand their friends or equals, or from any other king whose subjects\r\nare so disposed as to increase his happiness and peace, with whose\r\nhelp he may be able to recover his lost position, with whom his\r\nancestors were in close intimacy, or blood relationship, and in\r\nwhose kingdom he can find a number of powerful friends.\r\n\r\n* Of two powerful kings who are on amicable terms with each\r\nother, a king shall make alliance with one of them who likes him\r\nand whom he likes; this is the best way of making alliance.\r\n\r\n[Thus ends Chapter II, \u201cThe Nature of Alliance\u201d in Book VII, \u201cThe\r\nend of the Six-fold Policy\u201d of the Arthasdstra of Kautilya.

and an inferior king shall be attacked.\r\n\r\nWhoever goes to wage war with a superior king will be\r\nreduced to the same condition as that of a foot-soldier opposing an\r\nelephant.\r\n\r\nJust as the collision of an unbaked mud-vessel with a similar\r\nvessel is destructive to both, so war with an equal king brings ruin\r\nto both.\r\n\r\nLike a stone striking an earthen pot, a superior king attains\r\ndecisive victory over an inferior king.\r\n\r\nIf a superior king discards the proposal of an inferior king for\r\npeace, the latter should take the attitude of a conquered king, or\r\nplay the part of an inferior king towards a superior.\r\n\r\nWhen a king of equal power does not like peace, then the\r\nsame amount of vexation as his opponent has received at his hands\r\nshould be given to him in return; for it is power that brings about\r\npeace between any two kings: no piece of iron that is not made\r\nred-hot will combine with another piece of iron.\r\n\r\nWhen an inferior king is all submissive, peace should be\r\nmade with him; for when provoked by causing him troubles and\r\nanger, an inferior king, like a wild fire, will attack his enemy and\r\nwill also be favoured by (his) Circle of States.\r\n\r\nWhen a king in peace with another finds that greedy,\r\nimpoverished, and oppressed as are the subjects of his ally, they do\r\nnot yet immigrate into his own territory lest they might be called\r\nback by their master, then he should, though of inferior power,\r\nproclaim war against his ally.\r\n\r\n377\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nWhen a king at war with another finds that greedy,\r\nimpoverished, and oppressed as are the subjects of his enemy, still\r\nthey do not come to his side in consequence of the troubles of war,\r\nthen he should, though of superior power, make peace with his\r\nenemy or remove the troubles of war as far as possible.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 596179, "end_char_idx": 600080, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d26d7e4-c431-4e35-a84e-4bcadb978bd1": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d26d7e4-c431-4e35-a84e-4bcadb978bd1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4cc95a39-80ca-40d2-b4f2-19979899d1f8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "85e4542a0a9f2eaf6cff72a3fca82966ddaccd5345407e395c2c57824b1c9141", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e3c49559-1305-4cc8-9177-81ff9559315e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3c8f334e5488314a568bac41f937d62785b3b44c169635d46b552111491dece3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "When an inferior king is all submissive, peace should be\r\nmade with him;

When the desired end is achieved,\r\nthe inferior king will quietly retire after the satisfaction of his\r\nsuperior.\r\n\r\n* Till his discharge, the good conduct of an ally of usually bad\r\ncharacter should be closely scrutinised either by suddenly coming\r\nout at a critical time from a covert position (sattra) to examine his\r\nconduct, or by having his wife as a pledge for his good conduct.\r\n\r\n* Though actuated with feelings of true friendship, the conqueror\r\nhas reason to fear his ally, though of equal power, when the latter\r\nattains success in his mission; having succeeded in his mission, an\r\nally of equal power is likely to change his attitude even towards the\r\nconqueror of superior power.\r\n\r\n* An ally of superior power should not be relied upon, for\r\nprosperity changes the mind. Even with little or no share in the\r\nspoils, an ally of superior power may go back, appearing\r\ncontented; but some time afterwards, he may not fail to sit on the\r\nlap of the conqueror and carry off twice the amount of share due to\r\nhim.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 615931, "end_char_idx": 619884, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee54729c-9b4d-4fd6-a153-02286fc176ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee54729c-9b4d-4fd6-a153-02286fc176ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "de289aa2-2a44-4108-a6bb-498a10794d65", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "c0fccf325ea529b673e960062fb6eaf9e9f5ef3a813625233001d6af13201373", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f960656-faf6-43c0-ad75-bf586e4a18f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6015510c03c7f799a2e5ec0259ec8e2ba4b5583fe854bcdbe9d53ce67d0d6236", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "* Though actuated with feelings of true friendship, the conqueror\r\nhas reason to fear his ally, though of equal power, when the latter\r\nattains success in his mission; having succeeded in his mission, an\r\nally of equal power is likely to change his attitude even towards the\r\nconqueror of superior power.\r\n\r\n* An ally of superior power should not be relied upon, for\r\nprosperity changes the mind.

When the king is convinced of the truth, the amount\r\npromised may be paid; or having made that king to incur enmity\r\nwith other kings, the agreement itself may be broken off.\r\n\r\nWhen a king is inclined to cause to another, loss of men and\r\nmoney in the ill-considered undertakings of the latter or to frustrate\r\nthe latter in the attempt of achieving large profits from well-begun\r\nundertakings; or when he means to strike another at his (another's)\r\nown place or while marching; or when he intends to exact subsidy\r\nagain in combination with the latter's assailable enemy; or when he\r\nis in need of money and does not like to trust to his ally, he may, for\r\n\r\n400\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nthe time being, be satisfied with a small amount of profit.\r\n\r\nWhen aking has in view the necessity of helping a friend or of\r\ndestroying an enemy, or the possibility of acquiring much wealth\r\n(in return for the present help) or when he intends to utilize in\r\nfuture the services of the one now obliged by him, he may reject the\r\noffer of large profit at the present in preference of a small gain in\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nWhen a king means to help another from the clutches of\r\ntraitors or enemies or of a superior king threatening the very\r\nexistence of the latter, and intends thereby to set an example of\r\nrendering similar help to himself in future, he should receive no\r\nprofit either at the present or in the future.\r\n\r\nWhen a king means to harass the people of an enemy or to\r\nbreak the agreement of peace between a friend and a foe, or when\r\nhe suspects of another's attack upon himself, and when owing to\r\nany of these causes, he wants to break peace with his ally, he may\r\ndemand from the latter an enhanced amount of profit long before it\r\nis due.

whoever sides\r\nalso with the enemy is a mutable friend and whoever is indifferent\r\nto neither (the conqueror and his enemy) is a friend to both;\r\n\r\n* that friend who is inimical to the conqueror or who is equally\r\nfriendly to the conquerors enemy is a harmful friend, whether he is\r\ngiving help or is capable of helping;\r\n\r\n* whoever helps the enemy's friend, protege, or any vulnerable\r\n\r\n407\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nperson or a relation of the enemy is a friend common to (both) the\r\nenemy (and the conqueror);\r\n\r\n* whoever possesses extensive and fertile territory and is\r\ncontented, strong, but indolent, will be indifferent (towards his\r\nally) when the latter becomes despicable under troubles;\r\n\r\n* whoever, owing to his own weakness, follows the ascendancy of\r\nboth the conqueror and his enemy, not incurring enmity with\r\neither, is known as a common friend;\r\n\r\n* whoever neglects a friend who is being hurt with or without\r\nreason and who seeks help with or without reason despises his own\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nWhich is better, an immediate small gain, or a distant large\r\ngain?\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that an immediate small gain is better, as it is\r\nuseful to carry out immediate undertakings.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 648020, "end_char_idx": 652279, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af0044b1-7581-4e6b-8399-787aa0c5b7be": {"__data__": {"id_": "af0044b1-7581-4e6b-8399-787aa0c5b7be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "018f25b5-495e-418b-a560-5e91251a4452", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "f55413de207a98cd79626d8f95ce162370db877fbc129f6ec860f339a1fd6d8c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b57592d5-9d3a-4b02-9084-2c7f8a1e39c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "11bc0de4225f7309118b06d8a001745f422dcee6e7100d4124ac516e8a16a146", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Which is better, an immediate small gain, or a distant large\r\ngain?\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that an immediate small gain is better, as it is\r\nuseful to carry out immediate undertakings.\r\n\r\nNot so, says Kautilya: a large gain, as continuous as a\r\nproductive seed, is better;

True, there is beauty\r\nin acquiring land by putting down a weak enemy; but the land\r\nacquired will also be poor, and the king in the neighbourhood who\r\nhas hitherto been a friend, will now become an enemy.\r\n\r\nThe enemies being equally strong, he who acquires territory\r\nafter beating a fortified enemy overreaches the other; for the\r\ncapture of a fort is conducive to the protection of territory and to\r\nthe destruction of wild tribes.\r\n\r\nAs to the acquisition of land from a wandering enemy, there is\r\nthe difference of having a powerful or powerless enemy close to\r\nthe acquired territory; for the land which is close to a powerless\r\nenemy is easily maintained while that bordering upon the territory\r\nof a powerful enemy has to be kept at the expense of men and\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nWhich is better, the acquisition of a rich land close to a\r\nconstant enemy, or that of sterile land near to a temporary enemy?\r\n\r\nMy teacher say that a rich land with a constant enemy is\r\n\r\n409\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nbetter, inasmuch as it yields much wealth to maintain a strong\r\narmy, by which the enemy can be put down.\r\n\r\nNot so, says Kautilya: for a rich land creates many enemies,\r\nand the constant enemy will ever be an enemy, whether or not he is\r\nhelped (with men and money to conciliate him); but a temporary\r\nenemy will be quiet either from fear or favour. That land, on the\r\nborder of which there are a number of forts giving shelter to bands\r\nof thieves, Mlechchhas, and wild tribes is a land with a constant\r\nenemy; and that which is of reverse character is one with a\r\ntemporary enemy.\r\n\r\nWhich is better, a small piece of land, not far, or an extensive\r\npiece of land, very far?\r\n\r\nA small piece of land, not far, is better, inasmuch as it can be\r\neasily acquired, protected, and defended, whereas the other is of a\r\nreverse nature.\r\n\r\nOf the above two kinds of land, which is better, that which\r\ncan be maintained by itself, or that which requires external armed\r\nforce to maintain?\r\n\r\nThe former is better, as it can be maintained with the army\r\nand money produced by itself, whereas the latter is of a reverse\r\ncharacter as a military station.\r\n\r\nWhich is better, acquisition of land from a stupid or a wise\r\nking?\r\n\r\nThat acquired from a stupid king is better, as it can be easily\r\nacquired and secured, and cannot be taken back, whereas that\r\nobtained from a wise king, beloved of his subjects, is of a reverse\r\nnature.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 652099, "end_char_idx": 655943, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b57592d5-9d3a-4b02-9084-2c7f8a1e39c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "b57592d5-9d3a-4b02-9084-2c7f8a1e39c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "af0044b1-7581-4e6b-8399-787aa0c5b7be", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "60077b7afe6e9524d36957ca81f5d678fe01a3c73a151c7777d90fb934570a29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ea794e9e-4113-47e0-84b9-f15aa8204d7f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3761f50ec07576ae0999c8a60c0f7172556beb2937abb229d5874b045b7c7b3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Which is better, a small piece of land, not far, or an extensive\r\npiece of land, very far?\r\n\r\nA small piece of land, not far, is better, inasmuch as it can be\r\neasily acquired, protected, and defended, whereas the other is of a\r\nreverse nature.\r\n\r\nOf the above two kinds of land, which is better, that which\r\ncan be maintained by itself, or that which requires external armed\r\nforce to maintain?\r\n\r\nThe former is better, as it can be maintained with the army\r\nand money produced by itself, whereas the latter is of a reverse\r\ncharacter as a military station.\r\n\r\nWhich is better, acquisition of land from a stupid or a wise\r\nking?\r\n\r\nThat acquired from a stupid king is better, as it can be easily\r\nacquired and secured, and cannot be taken back, whereas that\r\nobtained from a wise king, beloved of his subjects, is of a reverse\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n410\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nOf two enemies, of whom one can only be harassed and\r\nanother is reducible, acquisition of land from the latter is better; for\r\nwhen the latter is attacked, he, having little or no help, begins to run\r\naway, taking his army and treasure with him, and he is deserted by\r\nhis subjects; whereas the former does not do so, as he has the help\r\nof his forts and friends..\r\n\r\nOf two fortified kings, one who has his forts on a plain is\r\nmore easily reduced than the other owning a fort in the centre of a\r\nriver; for a fort in a plain can be easily assailed, destroyed or\r\ncaptured along with the enemy in it, whereas a fort, surrounded by\r\na river requires twice as much effort to capture and supplies the\r\nenemy with water and other necessaries of life.\r\n\r\nOf two kings, one owning a fort surrounded by a river, and\r\nanother having mountainous fortifications, seizing the former's\r\nland is better, for a fort in the centre of a river can be assailed by a\r\nbridge formed of elephants made to stand in a row in the river or by\r\nwooden bridges, or by means of boats; and the river will not always\r\nbe deep and can be emptied of its water, whereas a fort on a\r\nmountain is of a self-defensive nature, and not easy to besiege or to\r\nascend; and when one portion of the army defending it is routed\r\nout, the other portions can escape unhurt and such a fort is of\r\nimmense service, as it affords facilities to throw down heaps of\r\nstone and trees over the enemy.\r\n\r\nWhich is easier, seizing land from those who fight on plains,\r\nor from those who fight from low grounds?\r\n\r\nSeizing the land from the latter is easier, inasmuch as they\r\nhave to fight in time and space of adverse nature whereas the\r\nformer can fight anywhere and at any time.\r\n\r\nOf the two enemies, one fighting from ditches and another\r\nfrom heights (khanakdkdsayodhibhydm), seizing land from the\r\n\r\n411\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nformer is better;

likewise river navigation is\r\nbetter, as it is uninterrupted and is of avoidable or endurable\r\ndangers.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of land-routes, that which leads to the\r\nHimalayas is better than that which leads to the south.\r\n\r\nNot so, says Kautilya, for with the exception of blankets,\r\nskins, and horses, other articles of merchandise such as,\r\nconch-shells, diamonds, precious stones, pearls and gold are\r\navailable in plenty in the south.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 664817, "end_char_idx": 668969, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "465e774d-419d-416d-a354-e6572f4b5a5c": {"__data__": {"id_": "465e774d-419d-416d-a354-e6572f4b5a5c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c591cd08-60cb-42c5-9178-96926670c51b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "abcf9d6396d82615ac16475924084e353aa967e19c978157e3e8ce8c65e4ccae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f34a684b-ac9c-4bfd-b60c-75c24f41284f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "af4c3115b20845785fe0a70a32033e712b969a9e20ad97720d76afaeb07d5d8e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Not so, says Kautilya, for water route is liable to obstruction,\r\nnot permanent, a source of imminent dangers, and incapable of\r\ndefence, whereas a land-route is of reverse nature.\r\n\r\nOf water-routes, one along the shore and another in\r\nmid-ocean, the route along, and close to the shore is better, as it\r\ntouches at many trading port-towns;

When the benefits are equal, the conqueror has to\r\nconsider that his condition is stagnant.\r\n\r\n* Likewise it is a loss to undertake a work of less out-put and of a\r\ngreater outlay, while a work of reverse nature is a gain.

for it is easier to make peace with a friend than with an\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nWhen there are two kings, one engaged in destroying a friend,\r\nand another an enemy, he who attacks the rear of the former gains\r\nmore advantages;

for a rear\r\nenemy on one of the assailant\u2019s flanks will not only become a\r\nfriend of the assailable enemy, but also attack the base of the\r\nassailant, whereas a rear-enemy behind the assailant can only\r\nharass the rear.\r\n\r\n* Kings, capable of harassing the rear of an enemy and of\r\nobstructing his movements are three: the group of kings situated\r\nbehind the enemy, and the group of kings on his flanks.\r\n\r\n* He who is situated between a conqueror and his enemy is called\r\nan antardhi (one between two kings); when such a king is\r\npossessed of forts, wild tribes, and other kinds of help, he proves an\r\nimpediment in the way of the strong.\r\n\r\nWhen the conqueror and his enemy are desirous of catching\r\nhold of a madhyama king and attack the latter's rear, then he who in\r\nhis attempt to enforce the promised payment separates the\r\nmadhyama king from the latter's friend and obtains, thereby, an\r\nenemy as a friend, gains more advantages;

then having set the dkranda (the\r\nenemy of the rear-enemy) against the rear-enemy's ally,\r\n\r\n* and, having caused war between them, the conqueror should\r\nfrustrate the rear-enemy's designs; likewise he should provoke\r\nhostilities between, the allies of the dkranda and of the rear-enemy;\r\n* he should also keep his frontal enemy's friend engaged in war\r\nwith his own friend;

and if among the madhyama king's friends who are either\r\nreducible or assailable enemies of the conqueror, some are capable\r\nof offence and defence and become friendly to the conqueror, then\r\nhe should make peace with them; thus the conqueror cannot only\r\nattain his own ends, but also please the madhyama king.\r\n\r\nIf the madhyama king is desirous of securing a would-be\r\nfriend of the conqueror as a friend, then the conqueror may make\r\npeace with another king, or prevent the friend from going to the\r\nmadhyama, telling him: \"It is unworthy of you to forsake a friend\r\nwho is desirous of your friendship,\u201d or the conqueror may keep\r\nquiet, if the conqueror thinks that the Circle of States would be\r\nenraged against the friend for deserting his own party. If the\r\nmadhyama king is desirous of securing the conqueror\u2019s enemy as\r\nhis friend, then the conqueror should indirectly (i.e., without being\r\nknown to the madhyama) help the enemy with wealth and army.\r\n\r\nIf the madhyama king desires to win the neutral king, the\r\nconqueror should sow the seeds of dissension between them.\r\nWhoever of the madhyama and the neutral kings is esteemed by the\r\nCircle of States, his protection should the conqueror seek.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the madhyama king explains that of the\r\nneutral king. If the neutral king is desirous of combining with the\r\nmadhyama king, then the conqueror should so attempt as to\r\n\r\n441\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nfrustrate the desire of the neutral king to overreach an enemy or to\r\nhelp a friend or to secure the services of the army of another neutral\r\nking. Having thus strengthened himself, the conqueror should\r\nreduce his enemies and help his friends, though their position is\r\ninimical towards him.\r\n\r\nThose who may be inimical to the conqueror are a king who is\r\nof wicked character and who is therefore always harmful, a\r\nrear-enemy in combination with a frontal enemy, a reducible\r\nenemy under troubles, and one who is watching the troubles of the\r\nconqueror to invade him.\r\n\r\nThose who may be friendly with the conqueror are one who\r\nmarches with him with the same end in view, one who marches\r\nwith him with a different end in view, one who wants to combine\r\nwith the conqueror to march (against a common enemy), one who\r\nmarches under an agreement for peace, one who marches with a set\r\npurpose of, his own, one who rises along with others, one who is\r\nready to purchase or to sell either the army or the treasury, and one\r\nwho adopts the double policy (i.e., making peace with one and\r\nwaging war with another).\r\n\r\nThose neighbouring kings who can be servants to the\r\nconqueror are a neighbouring king under the apprehension of an\r\nattack from a powerful king, one who is situated between the\r\nconqueror and his enemy, the rear-enemy of a powerful king, one\r\nwho has voluntarily surrendered one-self to the conqueror, one\r\nwho has surrendered oneself under fear, and one who has been\r\nsubdued.

THE AGGREGATE OF THE CALAMITIES\r\nOF THE ELEMENTS OF SOVEREIGNTY.\r\n\r\nWHEN calamities happen together, the form of consideration\r\n\r\n444\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nshould be whether it is easier to take an offensive or defensive\r\nattitude. National calamities, coming from Providence or from man\r\nhappen from one's misfortune or bad policy. The word vyasana\r\n(vices or calamities), means the reverse or absence of virtue, the\r\npreponderance of vices, and occasional troubles. That which\r\ndeprives (vyasyati) a person of his happiness is termed vyasana\r\n(vices or calamities).\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of the calamities, viz., the king in\r\ndistress, the minister in distress, the people in distress, distress due\r\nto bad fortifications, financial distress, the army in distress, and an\r\nally in distress,--that which is first mentioned is more serious than\r\nthe one, coming later in the order of enumeration.\r\n\r\nNo, says Bharadvdja, of the distress of the king and of his\r\nminister, ministerial distress is more serious; deliberations in\r\ncouncil, the attainment of results as anticipated while deliberating\r\nin council, the accomplishment of works, the business of\r\nrevenue-collection and its expenditure, recruiting the army, the\r\ndriving out of the enemy and of wild tribes, the protection of the\r\nkingdom, taking remedial measures against calamities, the\r\nprotection of the heir-apparent, and the installation of princes\r\nconstitute the duties of ministers. In the absence of ministers; the\r\nabove works are ill-done; and like a bird, deprived of its feathers,\r\nthe king loses his active capacity. In such calamities, the intrigues\r\nof the enemy find a ready scope. In ministerial distress, the king's\r\nlife itself comes into danger, for a minister is the mainstay of the\r\nsecurity of the king's life.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, it is verily the king who attends to the\r\nbusiness of appointing ministers, priests, and other servants,\r\nincluding the superintendents of several departments, the\r\napplication of remedies against the troubles of his people, and of\r\nhis kingdom, and the adoption of progressive measures; when his\r\n\r\n445\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nministers fall into troubles, he employs others; he is ever ready to\r\nbestow rewards on the worthy and inflict punishments on the\r\nwicked; when the king is well off, by his welfare and prosperity, he\r\npleases the people; of what kind the king's character is, of the same\r\nkind will be the character of his people; for their progress or\r\ndownfall, the people depend upon the king; the king is, as it were,\r\nthe aggregate of the people.\r\n\r\nVisdldksha says that of the troubles of the minister and of the\r\npeople; the troubles of the people are more serious; finance, army,\r\nraw products, free labour, carriage of things, and collection (of\r\nnecessaries) are all secured from the people. There will be no such\r\nthings in the absence of people, next to the king and his minister.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, all activities proceed from the minister,\r\nactivities such as the successful accomplishment of the works of\r\nthe people, security of person and property from internal and\r\nexternal enemies, remedial measures against calamities,\r\ncolonization and improvement of wild tracts of land, recruiting the\r\narmy, collection of revenue, and bestowal of favour.\r\n\r\nThe school of Pardsara say that of the distress of the people\r\nand distress due to bad fortifications, the latter is a more serious\r\nevil; for it is in fortified towns that the treasury and the army are\r\nsecured; they (fortified towns) are a secure place for the people;\r\nthey are a stronger power than the citizens or country people; and\r\nthey are a powerful defensive instrument in times of danger for the\r\nking.

As to the people, they are common both to the king and his\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, for forts, finance, and the army depend\r\nupon the people; likewise buildings, trade, agriculture,\r\ncattle-rearing, bravery, stability, power, and abundance (of things).\r\nIn countries inhabited by people, there are mountains and islands\r\n\r\n446\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\n(as natural forts); in the absence of an expansive country, forts are\r\nresorted to. When a country consists purely of cultivators, troubles\r\ndue to the absence of fortifications (are apparent); while in a\r\ncountry which consists purely of warlike people, troubles that may\r\nappear are due to the absence of (an expansive and cultivated)\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nPisuna says that of the troubles due to the absence of forts and\r\nto want of finance, troubles due to want of finance are more\r\nserious; the repair of fortifications and their maintenance depend\r\nupon finance; by means of wealth, intrigue to capture an enemy's\r\nfort may be carried on; by means of wealth, the people, friends, and\r\nenemies can be kept under control; by means of it, outsiders can be\r\nencouraged and the establishment of the army and its operations\r\nconducted. It is possible to remove the treasure in times of danger,\r\nbut not the fort.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, for it is in the fort that the treasury and the\r\narmy are safely kept, and it is from the fort that secret war\r\n(intrigue), control over one's partisans, the upkeep of the army, the\r\nreception of allies and the driving out of enemies and of wild tribes\r\nare successfully practised. In the absence of forts, the treasury is to\r\nthe enemy, for it seems that for those who own forts, there is no\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nKaunapadanta says that of distress due to want of finance or\r\nto an inefficient army, that which is due to the want of an efficient\r\narmy is more serious; for control over one's own friends and\r\nenemies, the winning over the army of an enemy, and the business\r\nof administration are all dependent upon the army. In the absence\r\nof the army, it is certain that the treasury will be lost, whereas lack\r\nof finance can be made up by procuring raw products and lands or\r\nby seizing an enemy's territory.\r\n\r\nThe army may go to the enemy, or murder the king himself,\r\n\r\n447\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nand bring about all kinds of troubles.

End of the hundred and\r\nseventeenth chapter from the beginning. ]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THE\r\nTROUBLES OF THE KING AND OF HIS KINGDOM.\r\n\r\nTHE king and his kingdom are the primary elements of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe troubles of the king may be either internal or external.\r\nInternal troubles are more serious than external troubles which are\r\nlike the danger arising from a lurking snake. Troubles due to a\r\nminister are more serious than other kinds of internal troubles.\r\nHence, the king should keep under his own control the powers of\r\nfinance and the army.\r\n\r\nOf divided rule and foreign rule, divided rule or rule of a\r\ncountry by two kings, perishes owing to mutual hatred, partiality\r\nand rivalry. Foreign rule which comes into existence by seizing the\r\ncountry from its king still alive, thinks that the country is not its\r\nown, impoverishes it, and carries off its wealth, or treats it as a\r\ncommercial article; and when the country ceases to love it, it retires\r\nabandoning the country.\r\n\r\nWhich is better, a blind king, or a king erring against the\r\nscience?\r\n\r\n449\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that a blind king, i.e., a king who is not\r\npossessed of an eye in sciences, is indiscriminate in doing works,\r\nvery obstinate, and is led by others; such a king destroys the\r\nkingdom by his own maladministration. But an erring king can be\r\neasily brought round when and where his mind goes astray from\r\nthe procedure laid down in sciences.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, a blind king can be made by his supporters\r\nto adhere to whatever line of policy he ought to. But an erring king\r\nwho is bent upon doing what is against the science, brings about\r\ndestruction to himself and his kingdom by maladministration.\r\n\r\nWhich is better, a diseased or a new king ?", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 720788, "end_char_idx": 724931, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad612486-563b-4a0a-9a4e-cdafc2a1722e": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad612486-563b-4a0a-9a4e-cdafc2a1722e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4220b84c-0e07-48d8-9ff5-65ff0fa94ff1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "b4f01a7bda8a82e1369b7a6ddc6a1e129e89726c7e2b68be1670538a6bd0f230", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6e2b68ed-2801-4901-9648-7512e995a22a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "17f78be836a01da6d7eebe6c8b66d291edb35a4a689c1e3869a1f22098c2a100", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Which is better, a blind king, or a king erring against the\r\nscience?\r\n\r\n449\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that a blind king, i.e., a king who is not\r\npossessed of an eye in sciences, is indiscriminate in doing works,\r\nvery obstinate, and is led by others; such a king destroys the\r\nkingdom by his own maladministration.

But a new king begins to act as he pleases under the\r\nimpression that the country, acquired by his own might, belongs to\r\nhimself; when pressed by combined kings (for plunder), he\r\ntolerates their oppression of the country. Or having no firm control\r\nover the elements of the state, he is easily removed. There is this\r\ndifference among diseased kings: a king who is morally diseased,\r\nand a king who is suffering from physical disease; there is also this\r\ndifference among new kings: a high-born king and a base-born\r\nking.\r\n\r\nWhich is better, a weak but high-born king, or a strong but\r\nlow-born king?\r\n\r\n450\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that a people, even if interested in having a\r\nweak king, hardly allow room for the intrigues of a weak but\r\nhigh-born person to be their king; but that if they desire power,\r\nthey will easily yield themselves to the intrigues of a strong but\r\nbase-born person to be their king.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, a people will naturally obey a high-born\r\nking though he is weak, for the tendency of a prosperous people is\r\nto follow a high-born king. Also they render the intrigues of a\r\nstrong but base-born person, unavailing, as the saying is, that\r\npossession of virtues makes for friendship.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of crops is worse than the destruction of\r\nhandfuls (of grains), since it is the labour that is destroyed thereby;\r\nabsence of rain is worse than too much rain.\r\n\r\n* The comparative seriousness or insignificance of any two\r\nkinds of troubles affecting the elements of sovereignty, in the order\r\nof enumeration of the several kinds of distress, is the cause of\r\nadopting offensive or defensive operations.\r\n\r\n[Thus ends Chapter 11, \"Considerations about the Troubles of the\r\nKing and of his Kingdom,\u201d in Book VIII, \u201cConceming Vices and\r\nCalamities,\u201d of the Arthasdstra of Kautilya.

But kings addicted to pleasures have\r\nperished in consequence of serious diseases brought about by\r\ndeterioration and improverishment.\r\n\r\nNo, says Bhdradvdja, anger is the characteristic of a\r\nrighteous man. It is the foundation of bravery; it puts an end to\r\ndespicable (persons); and it keeps the people under fear. Anger is\r\nalways a necessary quality for the prevention of sin. But desire\r\n(accompanies) the enjoyment of results, reconciliation, generosity,\r\nand the act of endearing oneself to all. Possession of desire is\r\nalways necessary for him who is inclined to enjoy the fruits of what\r\nhe has accomplished.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, anger brings about enmity with, and\r\ntroubles from, an enemy, and is always associated with pain.\r\nAddiction to pleasure (kdma) occasions contempt and loss of\r\nwealth, and throws the addicted person into the company of\r\nthieves, gamblers, hunters, singers, players on musical\r\ninstruments, and other undesirable persons. Of these, enmity is\r\nmore serious than contempt, for a despised person is caught hold of\r\nby his own people and by his enemies, whereas a hated person is\r\ndestroyed. Troubles from an enemy are more serious than loss of\r\nwealth, for loss of wealth causes financial troubles, whereas\r\ntroubles from an enemy are injurious to life. Suffering on account\r\nof vices is more serious than keeping company with undesirable\r\npersons, for the company of undesirable persons can be got rid of\r\nin a moment, whereas suffering from vices causes injury for a long\r\ntime. Hence, anger is a more serious evil.\r\n\r\nWhich is worse: abuse of language, or of money, or\r\noppressive punishment?\r\n\r\n452\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nVisdldksha says that of abuse of language and of money,\r\nabuse of language is worse; for when harshly spoken to, a brave\r\nman retaliates; and bad language, like a nail piercing the heart,\r\nexcites anger and gives pain to the senses.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, gift of money palliates the fury occasioned\r\nby abusive language, whereas abuse of money causes the loss of\r\nlivelihood itself. Abuse of money means gifts, exaction, loss or\r\nabandonment of money.\r\n\r\nThe School of Pardsara say that of abuse of money and\r\noppressive punishment, abuse of money is worse; for good deeds\r\nand enjoyments depend upon wealth; the world itself is bound by\r\nwealth. Hence, its abuse is a more serious evil.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, in preference to a large amount of wealth,\r\nno man desires the loss of his own life. Owing to oppressive\r\npunishment, one is liable to the same punishment at the hands of\r\none's enemies.\r\n\r\nSuch is the nature of the triad of evils due to anger.\r\n\r\nThe fourfold vices due to desire are hunting, gambling,\r\nwomen and drinking.\r\n\r\nPisuna says that of hunting and gambling, hunting is a worse\r\nvice; for falling into the hand of robbers, enemies and elephants,\r\ngetting into wild fire, fear, inability to distinguish between the\r\ncardinal points, hunger, thirst and loss of life are evils consequent\r\nupon hunting, whereas in gambling, the expert gambler wins a\r\nvictory like Jayatsena and Duryodhana.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, of the two parties, one has to suffer from\r\ndefeat, as is well known from the history of Nala and Yudhishthira;\r\n\r\n453\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nthe same wealth that is won like a piece of flesh in gambling,\r\ncauses enmity.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 727376, "end_char_idx": 731075, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "adddd9b2-50b7-4f4f-8d7b-d97497043af0": {"__data__": {"id_": "adddd9b2-50b7-4f4f-8d7b-d97497043af0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e2b68ed-2801-4901-9648-7512e995a22a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "413d00c626bb000d0ddaaf060adf2eb57914638e556fa7960fdae8525e99e01f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3d8e6985-ce2b-4f89-ac62-ec7895310d8b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b777ab2b53e00c259b11fd7efb7851b33fbcb042cd65018567caf6b08bca6932", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Such is the nature of the triad of evils due to anger.\r\n\r\nThe fourfold vices due to desire are hunting, gambling,\r\nwomen and drinking.\r\n\r\nPisuna says that of hunting and gambling, hunting is a worse\r\nvice; for falling into the hand of robbers, enemies and elephants,\r\ngetting into wild fire, fear, inability to distinguish between the\r\ncardinal points, hunger, thirst and loss of life are evils consequent\r\nupon hunting, whereas in gambling, the expert gambler wins a\r\nvictory like Jayatsena and Duryodhana.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, of the two parties, one has to suffer from\r\ndefeat, as is well known from the history of Nala and Yudhishthira;\r\n\r\n453\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nthe same wealth that is won like a piece of flesh in gambling,\r\ncauses enmity. Lack of recognition of wealth properly acquired,\r\nacquisition of ill-gotten wealth, loss of wealth without enjoyment,\r\nstaying away from answering the calls of nature, and contracting\r\ndiseases from not taking timely meals, are the evils of gambling,\r\nwhereas in hunting, exercise, the disappearance of phlegm, bile,\r\nfat, and sweat, the acquisition of skill in aiming at stationary and\r\nmoving bodies, the ascertainment of the appearance of beasts when\r\nprovoked, and occasional march (are its good characteristics).\r\n\r\nKaunapadanta says that of addiction to gambling and to\r\nwomen, gambling is a more serious evil; for gamblers always play,\r\neven at night by lamp light, and even when the mother (of one of\r\nthe players) is dead; the gambler exhibits anger when spoken to in\r\ntimes of trouble; whereas in the case of addiction to women, it is\r\npossible to hold conversation about virtue and wealth, at the time\r\nof bathing, dressing and eating. Also it is possible to make, by\r\nmeans of secret punishment, a woman to be so good as to secure\r\nthe welfare of the king, or to get rid of her, or drive her out, under\r\nthe plea of disease.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, it is possible to divert the attention from\r\ngambling, but not so from women. (The evils of the latter are)\r\nfailure to see (what ought to be seen), violation of duty, the evil of\r\npostponing works that are to be immediately done, incapacity to\r\ndeal with politics, and contracting the evil of drinking.\r\n\r\nVitavyddhi says that of addiction to women and to drinking,\r\naddiction to women is a more serious evil: there are various kinds\r\nof childishness among women, as explained in the chapter on \u201cThe\r\nHarem,\u201d whereas in drinking, the enjoyment of sound and other\r\nobjects of the senses, pleasing other people, honouring the\r\nfollowers, and relaxation from the fatigue of work (are the\r\nadvantages).\r\n\r\n454\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, in the case of addiction to women, the\r\nconsequences are the birth of children, self-protection, change of\r\nwives in the harem, and absence of such consequences in the case\r\nof unworthy outside women. Both the above consequences follow\r\nfrom drinking. The auspicious effects of drinking are loss of\r\nmoney, lunacy in a sensate man, corpselike appearance while\r\nliving, nakedness, the loss of the knowledge of the Vedas, loss of\r\nlife, wealth, and friends, disassociation with the good, suffering\r\nfrom pain, and indulgence in playing on musical instruments and in\r\nsinging at the expense of wealth.\r\n\r\nOf gambling and drinking, gambling causes gain or loss of the\r\nstakes to one party or other.

THE GROUP OF MOLESTATIONS, THE\r\nGROUP OF OBSTRUCTIONS, AND THE GROUP OF\r\nFINANCIAL TROUBLES.\r\n\r\nPROVIDENTIAL calamities are fire, floods, pestilence,\r\nfamine, and (the epidemic disease called) maraka.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of fire and floods, destruction due to fire\r\nis irremediable; all kinds of troubles, except those due to fire, can\r\nbe alleviated, and troubles due to floods can be passed over.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, fire destroys a village, or part of a village\r\nwhereas floods carry off hundreds of villages.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of pestilence and famine, pestilence\r\nbrings all kinds of business to a stop by causing obstruction to work\r\non account of disease and death among men and owing to the flight\r\nof servants, whereas famine stops no work, but is productive of\r\ngold, cattle and taxes.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, pestilence devastates only a part (of the\r\ncountry) and can be remedied, whereas famine causes troubles to\r\nthe whole (of the country) and occasions dearth of livelihood to all\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\nThis explains the consequences of maraka.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of the loss of chief and vulgar men, the\r\nloss of vulgar men causes obstruction to work.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, it is possible to recruit vulgar men, since\r\nthey form the majority of people; for the sake of vulgar men,\r\nnobles should not be allowed to perish; one in a thousand may or\r\nmay not be a noble man; he it is who is possessed of excessive\r\ncourage and wisdom and is the refuge of vulgar people.\r\n\r\n456\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of the troubles arising from one's own or\r\none\u2019s enemy's Circle of States, those due to one's own Circle are\r\ndoubly injurious and are irremediable, whereas an inimical Circle\r\nof States can be fought out or kept away by the intervention of an\r\nally or by making peace.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, troubles due to one's own Circle can be got\r\nrid of by arresting or destroying the leaders among the subjective\r\npeople; or they may be injurious to a part of the country, whereas\r\ntroubles due to an enemy's Circle of States cause oppression by\r\ninflicting loss and destruction and by burning, devastation, and\r\nplunder.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of the quarrels among the people and\r\namong kings, quarrel among the people brings about disunion and\r\nthereby enables an enemy to invade the country, whereas quarrel\r\namong kings is productive of double pay and wages and of\r\nremission of taxes to the people.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, it is possible to end the quarrel among the\r\npeople by arresting the leaders, or by removing the cause of\r\nquarrel; and people quarrelling among themselves vie with each\r\nother and thereby help the country, whereas quarrel among kings\r\ncauses trouble and destruction to the people and requires double\r\nthe energy for its settlement.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of a sportive king and a sportive country,\r\na sportive country is always ruinous to the results of work, whereas\r\na sportive king is beneficial to artisans, carpenters, musicians,\r\nbuffoons and traders.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 733684, "end_char_idx": 737763, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c02c5a6-e560-416e-8180-5af0a8563926": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c02c5a6-e560-416e-8180-5af0a8563926", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d8e6985-ce2b-4f89-ac62-ec7895310d8b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "8c5a33922e930a5b309fc37e631316199b3f5f4564f6a1abe03ffb0f5a7553a9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c739cdbc-6f49-4f7f-a05a-997a10c63cc9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "65df91879470caeda551b51445d01f5202802c91a50103f7d64f387f8b155f44", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "My teacher says that of the quarrels among the people and\r\namong kings, quarrel among the people brings about disunion and\r\nthereby enables an enemy to invade the country, whereas quarrel\r\namong kings is productive of double pay and wages and of\r\nremission of taxes to the people.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, it is possible to end the quarrel among the\r\npeople by arresting the leaders, or by removing the cause of\r\nquarrel;

and after\r\nenjoyment, it resumes work, whereas a sportive king causes\r\n\r\n457\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\noppression by showing indulgence to his courtiers, by seizing and\r\nbegging, and by obstructing work in the manufactories.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of a favourite wife and a prince, the\r\nprince causes oppression by showing indulgence to his followers,\r\nby seizing and begging, and by obstructing the work in\r\nmanufactories whereas the favourite wife is addicted to her\r\namorous Sports.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, it is possible to prevent through the\r\nminister and the priest, the oppression caused by the prince, but not\r\nthe oppression caused by the favourite wife, since she is usually\r\nstubborn and keeps company with wicked persons.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of the troubles due to a corporation of\r\npeople and to a leader (a chief), the corporation of people people\r\ncannot be put down since it consists of a number of men and causes\r\noppression by theft and violence, whereas a leader causes troubles\r\nby obstruction to, and destruction of, work.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, it is very easy to get rid of (the troubles\r\nfrom) a corporation;

the\r\n\r\n464\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\ntroubles caused by an enemy, and should ever be ready to strike his\r\nenemy's army when the latter is under troubles;\r\n\r\n* Whatever he may come to know as the source of trouble to his\r\npeople, he should quickly and carefully apply antidotes against that\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n* A friend who, by himself, or in combination with others or under\r\nthe influence of another king, has marched against his own ally, a\r\nfriend who is abandoned owing to inability to retain his friendship,\r\nor owing to greediness or indifference;\r\n\r\n* A friend who is bought by another and who has withdrawn\r\nhimself from fighting;\r\n\r\n* A friend who, following the policy of making peace with one\r\nand marching against another, has contracted friendship with one,\r\nwho is going to march either singly or in combination with others\r\nagainst an ally;\r\n\r\n* A friend who is not relieved from his troubles owing to fear,\r\ncontempt, or indifference; a friend who is surrounded in his own\r\nplace or who has run away owing to fear;\r\n\r\n* A friend who is displeased owing to his having to pay much, or\r\nowing to his not having received his due or owing to his\r\ndissatisfaction even after the receipt of his due;\r\n\r\n* A friend who has voluntarily paid much or who is made by\r\nanother to pay much (to his ally); a friend who is kept under\r\npressure, or who, having broken the bond of friendship, sought\r\nfriendship with another;\r\n\r\n* A friend who is neglected owing to inability to retain his\r\nfriendship; and a friend who has become an enemy in spite of his\r\nally's entreaties to the contrary;--such friends are hardly acquired;\r\nand if acquired at all, they turn away.\r\n\r\n*A friend who has realised the responsibilities of friendship, or\r\nwho is honourable; or whose disappointment is due to want of\r\ninformation, or who, though excited, is unequal (to the task), or\r\nwho is made to turn back owing to fear from another;\r\n\r\n* Or who is frightened at the destruction of another friend, or who\r\n\r\n465\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nis apprehensive of danger from the combination of enemies, or\r\nwho is made by traitors to give up his friendship,--it is possible to\r\nacquire such a friend; and if acquired, he keeps up his friendship.\r\n* Henceone should not give rise to those causes which are\r\ndestructive of friendship; and when they arise, one should get rid of\r\nthem by adopting such friendly attitude as can remove those\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n[Thus ends Chapter V, \"The

In the absence of ministers; the\r\nabove works are ill-done; and like a bird, deprived of its feathers,\r\n\r\n467\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nthe king loses his active capacity. In such calamities, the intrigues\r\nof the enemy find a ready scope. In ministerial distress, the king's\r\nlife itself comes into danger, for a minister is the mainstay of the\r\nsecurity of the king's life.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, it is verily the king who attends to the\r\nbusiness of appointing ministers, priests, and other servants,\r\nincluding the superintendents of several departments, the\r\napplication of remedies against the troubles of his people, and of\r\nhis kingdom, and the adoption of progressive measures; when his\r\nministers fall into troubles, he employs others; he is ever ready to\r\nbestow rewards on the worthy and inflict punishments on the\r\nwicked; when the king is well off, by his welfare and prosperity, he\r\npleases the people; of what kind the king's character is, of the same\r\nkind will be the character of his people; for their progress or\r\ndownfall, the people depend upon the king; the king is, as it were,\r\nthe aggregate of the people.\r\n\r\nVisdldksha says that of the troubles of the minister and of the\r\npeople; the troubles of the people are more serious; finance, army,\r\nraw products, free labour, carriage of things, and collection (of\r\nnecessaries) are all secured from the people. There will be no such\r\nthings in the absence of people, next to the king and his minister.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, all activities proceed from the minister,\r\nactivities such as the successful accomplishment of the works of\r\nthe people, security of person and property from internal and\r\nexternal enemies, remedial measures against calamities,\r\ncolonization and improvement of wild tracts of land, recruiting the\r\narmy, collection of revenue, and bestowal of favour.\r\n\r\nThe school of Pardsara say that of the distress of the people\r\nand distress due to bad fortifications, the latter is a more serious\r\nevil; for it is in fortified towns that the treasury and the army are\r\n\r\n468\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nsecured; they (fortified towns) are a secure place for the people;\r\nthey are a stronger power than the citizens or country people; and\r\nthey are a powerful defensive instrument in times of danger for the\r\nking.

When a country consists purely of cultivators, troubles\r\ndue to the absence of fortifications (are apparent); while in a\r\ncountry which consists purely of warlike people, troubles that may\r\nappear are due to the absence of (an expansive and cultivated)\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nPisuna says that of the troubles due to the absence of forts and\r\nto want of finance, troubles due to want of finance are more\r\nserious; the repair of fortifications and their maintenance depend\r\nupon finance; by means of wealth, intrigue to capture an enemy's\r\nfort may be carried on; by means of wealth, the people, friends, and\r\nenemies can be kept under control; by means of it, outsiders can be\r\nencouraged and the establishment of the army and its operations\r\nconducted. It is possible to remove the treasure in times of danger,\r\nbut not the fort.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, for it is in the fort that the treasury and the\r\narmy are safely kept, and it is from the fort that secret war\r\n(intrigue), control over one's partisans, the upkeep of the army, the\r\nreception of allies and the driving out of enemies and of wild tribes\r\nare successfully practised. In the absence of forts, the treasury is to\r\nthe enemy, for it seems that for those who own forts, there is no\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n469\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nKaunapadanta says that of distress due to want of finance or\r\nto an inefficient army, that which is due to the want of an efficient\r\narmy is more serious; for control over one's own friends and\r\nenemies, the winning over the army of an enemy, and the business\r\nof administration are all dependent upon the army. In the absence\r\nof the army, it is certain that the treasury will be lost, whereas lack\r\nof finance can be made up by procuring raw products and lands or\r\nby seizing an enemy's territory.\r\n\r\nThe army may go to the enemy, or murder the king himself,\r\nand bring about all kinds of troubles. But finance is the chief means\r\nof observing virtuous acts and of enjoying desires.

End of the hundred and\r\nseventeenth chapter from the beginning. ]\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT THE\r\nTROUBLES OF THE KING AND OF HIS KINGDOM.\r\n\r\nTHE king and his kingdom are the primary elements of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nThe troubles of the king may be either internal or external.\r\nInternal troubles are more serious than external troubles which are\r\nlike the danger arising from a lurking snake. Troubles due to a\r\nminister are more serious than other kinds of internal troubles.\r\nHence, the king should keep under his own control the powers of\r\nfinance and the army.\r\n\r\n471\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nOf divided rule and foreign rule, divided rule or rule of a\r\ncountry by two kings, perishes owing to mutual hatred, partiality\r\nand rivalry.

Also they render the intrigues of a\r\nstrong but base-born person, unavailing, as the saying is, that\r\npossession of virtues makes for friendship.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of crops is worse than the destruction of\r\nhandfuls (of grains), since it is the labour that is destroyed thereby;\r\nabsence of rain is worse than too much rain.\r\n\r\n* The comparative seriousness or insignificance of any two\r\nkinds of troubles affecting the elements of sovereignty, in the order\r\nof enumeration of the several kinds of distress, is the cause of\r\nadopting offensive or defensive operations.\r\n\r\n[Thus ends Chapter 11, \"Considerations about the Troubles of the\r\nKing and of his Kingdom,\u201d in Book VIII, \u201cConcerning Vices and\r\n\r\n473\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nCalamities,\u201d of the Arthasdstra of Kautilya.

But desire\r\n(accompanies) the enjoyment of results, reconciliation, generosity,\r\nand the act of endearing oneself to all. Possession of desire is\r\nalways necessary for him who is inclined to enjoy the fruits of what\r\nhe has accomplished.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, anger brings about enmity with, and\r\ntroubles from, an enemy, and is always associated with pain.\r\nAddiction to pleasure (kdma) occasions contempt and loss of\r\nwealth, and throws the addicted person into the company of\r\nthieves, gamblers, hunters, singers, players on musical\r\ninstruments, and other undesirable persons. Of these, enmity is\r\nmore serious than contempt, for a despised person is caught hold of\r\nby his own people and by his enemies, whereas a hated person is\r\n\r\n474\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\ndestroyed. Troubles from an enemy are more serious than loss of\r\nwealth, for loss of wealth causes financial troubles, whereas\r\ntroubles from an enemy are injurious to life. Suffering on account\r\nof vices is more serious than keeping company with undesirable\r\npersons, for the company of undesirable persons can be got rid of\r\nin a moment, whereas suffering from vices causes injury for a long\r\ntime. Hence, anger is a more serious evil.\r\n\r\nWhich is worse: abuse of language, or of money, or\r\noppressive punishment?\r\n\r\nVisdldksha says that of abuse of language and of money,\r\nabuse of language is worse; for when harshly spoken to, a brave\r\nman retaliates; and bad language, like a nail piercing the heart,\r\nexcites anger and gives pain to the senses.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, gift of money palliates the fury occasioned\r\nby abusive language, whereas abuse of money causes the loss of\r\nlivelihood itself. Abuse of money means gifts, exaction, loss or\r\nabandonment of money.\r\n\r\nThe School of Pardsara say that of abuse of money and\r\noppressive punishment, abuse of money is worse; for good deeds\r\nand enjoyments depend upon wealth; the world itself is bound by\r\nwealth. Hence, its abuse is a more serious evil.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, in preference to a large amount of wealth,\r\nno man desires the loss of his own life. Owing to oppressive\r\npunishment, one is liable to the same punishment at the hands of\r\n\r\none's enemies.\r\n\r\nSuch is the nature of the triad of evils due to anger.\r\n\r\n475\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nThe fourfold vices due to desire are hunting, gambling,\r\nwomen and drinking.\r\n\r\nPisuna says that of hunting and gambling, hunting is a worse\r\nvice; for falling into the hand of robbers, enemies and elephants,\r\ngetting into wild fire, fear, inability to distinguish between the\r\ncardinal points, hunger, thirst and loss of life are evils consequent\r\nupon hunting, whereas in gambling, the expert gambler wins a\r\nvictory like Jayatsena and Duryodhana.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, of the two parties, one has to suffer from\r\ndefeat, as is well known from the history of Nala and Yudhishthira;\r\nthe same wealth that is won like a piece of flesh in gambling,\r\ncauses enmity. Lack of recognition of wealth properly acquired,\r\nacquisition of ill-gotten wealth, loss of wealth without enjoyment,\r\nstaying away from answering the calls of nature, and contracting\r\ndiseases from not taking timely meals, are the evils of gambling,\r\nwhereas in hunting, exercise, the disappearance of phlegm, bile,\r\nfat, and sweat, the acquisition of skill in aiming at stationary and\r\nmoving bodies, the ascertainment of the appearance of beasts when\r\nprovoked, and occasional march (are its good characteristics).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 765418, "end_char_idx": 769536, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa039c57-11eb-4c20-93ba-4ddb41a6e26c": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa039c57-11eb-4c20-93ba-4ddb41a6e26c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9302a864-00a0-447c-a3c5-802210dd3582", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "18a617b99d93721b8f3902540d77c00dba3aadf12f39ef65d8d0745c4c0843fe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "57ab8f94-6cf6-4aea-a370-de434b34d6a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e6e4c9e8d83643647aac0a9d6fe76d39d186b5e98b936a413ae5bba752fffdde", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "No, says Kautilya, of the two parties, one has to suffer from\r\ndefeat, as is well known from the history of Nala and Yudhishthira;\r\nthe same wealth that is won like a piece of flesh in gambling,\r\ncauses enmity.

Also it is possible to make, by\r\nmeans of secret punishment, a woman to be so good as to secure\r\nthe welfare of the king, or to get rid of her, or drive her out, under\r\nthe plea of disease.\r\n\r\n476\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, it is possible to divert the attention from\r\ngambling, but not so from women. (The evils of the latter are)\r\nfailure to see (what ought to be seen), violation of duty, the evil of\r\npostponing works that are to be immediately done, incapacity to\r\ndeal with politics, and contracting the evil of drinking.\r\n\r\nVitavyddhi says that of addiction to women and to drinking,\r\naddiction to women is a more serious evil: there are various kinds\r\nof childishness among women, as explained in the chapter on \u201cThe\r\nHarem,\u201d whereas in drinking, the enjoyment of sound and other\r\nobjects of the senses, pleasing other people, honouring the\r\nfollowers, and relaxation from the fatigue of work (are the\r\nadvantages).\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, in the case of addiction to women, the\r\nconsequences are the birth of children, self-protection, change of\r\nwives in the harem, and absence of such consequences in the case\r\nof unworthy outside women. Both the above consequences follow\r\nfrom drinking. The auspicious effects of drinking are loss of\r\nmoney, lunacy in a sensate man, corpselike appearance while\r\nliving, nakedness, the loss of the knowledge of the Vedas, loss of\r\nlife, wealth, and friends, disassociation with the good, suffering\r\nfrom pain, and indulgence in playing on musical instruments and in\r\nsinging at the expense of wealth.\r\n\r\nOf gambling and drinking, gambling causes gain or loss of\r\nthe stakes to one party or other. Even among dumb animals, it splits\r\nthem into factions and causes provocation. It is specially due to\r\ngambling that assemblies and royal confederacies possessing the\r\ncharacteristics of assemblies are split into factions, and are\r\nconsequently destroyed.

THE GROUP OF MOLESTATIONS, THE\r\nGROUP OF OBSTRUCTIONS, AND THE GROUP OF\r\nFINANCIAL TROUBLES.\r\n\r\nPROVIDENTIAL calamities are fire, floods, pestilence,\r\nfamine, and (the epidemic disease called) maraka.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of fire and floods, destruction due to fire\r\nis irremediable; all kinds of troubles, except those due to fire, can\r\nbe alleviated, and troubles due to floods can be passed over.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, fire destroys a village, or part of a village\r\nwhereas floods carry off hundreds of villages.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of pestilence and famine, pestilence\r\nbrings all kinds of business to a stop by causing obstruction to work\r\non account of disease and death among men and owing to the flight\r\nof servants, whereas famine stops no work, but is productive of\r\ngold, cattle and taxes.\r\n\r\n478\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, pestilence devastates only a part (of the\r\ncountry) and can be remedied, whereas famine causes troubles to\r\nthe whole (of the country) and occasions dearth of livelihood to all\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\nThis explains the consequences of maraka.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of the loss of chief and vulgar men, the\r\nloss of vulgar men causes obstruction to work.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, it is possible to recruit vulgar men, since\r\nthey form the majority of people; for the sake of vulgar men,\r\nnobles should not be allowed to perish; one in a thousand may or\r\nmay not be a noble man; he it is who is possessed of excessive\r\ncourage and wisdom and is the refuge of vulgar people.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of the troubles arising from one's own or\r\none\u2019s enemy's Circle of States, those due to one's own Circle are\r\ndoubly injurious and are irremediable, whereas an inimical Circle\r\nof States can be fought out or kept away by the intervention of an\r\nally or by making peace.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, troubles due to one's own Circle can be got\r\nrid of by arresting or destroying the leaders among the subjective\r\npeople; or they may be injurious to a part of the country, whereas\r\ntroubles due to an enemy's Circle of States cause oppression by\r\ninflicting loss and destruction and by burning, devastation, and\r\nplunder.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of the quarrels among the people and\r\namong kings, quarrel among the people brings about disunion and\r\nthereby enables an enemy to invade the country, whereas quarrel\r\namong kings is productive of double pay and wages and of\r\nremission of taxes to the people.\r\n\r\n479\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, it is possible to end the quarrel among the\r\npeople by arresting the leaders, or by removing the cause of\r\nquarrel; and people quarrelling among themselves vie with each\r\nother and thereby help the country, whereas quarrel among kings\r\ncauses trouble and destruction to the people and requires double\r\nthe energy for its settlement.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of a sportive king and a sportive country,\r\na sportive country is always ruinous to the results of work, whereas\r\na sportive king is beneficial to artisans, carpenters, musicians,\r\nbuffoons and traders.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, a sportive country, taking to sports for\r\nrelaxation from labour, causes only a trifling loss; and after\r\nenjoyment, it resumes work, whereas a sportive king causes\r\noppression by showing indulgence to his courtiers, by seizing and\r\nbegging, and by obstructing work in the manufactories.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of a favourite wife and a prince, the\r\nprince causes oppression by showing indulgence to his followers,\r\nby seizing and begging, and by obstructing the work in\r\nmanufactories whereas the favourite wife is addicted to her\r\namorous Sports.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 772228, "end_char_idx": 776311, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22f42739-69fc-41a2-aab4-32604e233bad": {"__data__": {"id_": "22f42739-69fc-41a2-aab4-32604e233bad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "57ab8f94-6cf6-4aea-a370-de434b34d6a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "a8972e47639ca389b74d377f9945028a8a2425c9a78711c6dd5da5068cdcdcc8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "81e57464-4028-4380-aae9-c5a728561b86", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c5158daf8f3c12d7febf31cfa50baacbaa46b7f5af44703cf69d6df4ab1baf32", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "My teacher says that of a sportive king and a sportive country,\r\na sportive country is always ruinous to the results of work, whereas\r\na sportive king is beneficial to artisans, carpenters, musicians,\r\nbuffoons and traders.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, a sportive country, taking to sports for\r\nrelaxation from labour, causes only a trifling loss;

since it has to rise or fall with the king; or it\r\ncan be put down by arresting its leader or a part of the corporation\r\nitself, whereas a leader backed up with support causes oppression\r\nby injuring the life and property of others.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of the chamberlain and the collector of\r\nrevenue, the chamberlain causes oppression by spoiling works and\r\nby inflicting fines, whereas the collector of revenue makes use of\r\nthe ascertained revenue in the department over which he presides.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, the chamberlain takes to himself what is\r\npresented by others to be entered into the treasury whereas the\r\ncollector makes his own revenue first and then the kings\u2019; or he\r\ndestroys the kings\u2019 revenue and proceeds as he pleases to seize the\r\nproperty of others.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of the superintendent of the boundary\r\nand a trader, the superintendent of the boundary destroys traffic by\r\nallowing thieves and taking taxes more than he ought to, whereas a\r\ntrader renders the country prosperous by a favourable barter of\r\ncommercial articles.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, the superintendent of the boundary\r\nincreases commercial traffic by welcoming the arrival of\r\nmerchandise, whereas traders unite in causing rise and fall in the\r\nvalue of articles, and live by making profits cent per cent in panas\r\nor kumbhas (measures of grain).\r\n\r\nWhich is more desirable, land occupied by a high-born\r\nperson or land reserved for grazing a flock of cattle?\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that the land occupied by a high-born person\r\nis very productive; and it supplies men to the army; hence it does\r\n\r\n481\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nnot deserve to be confiscated lest the owner might cause troubles,\r\nwhereas the land occupied for grazing a flock of cattle is cultivable\r\nand deserves therefore to be freed, for cultivable land is preferred\r\nto pasture land.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, though immensely useful, the land\r\noccupied by a high-born person deserves to be freed, lest he might\r\ncause troubles (otherwise), whereas the land held for grazing a\r\nflock of cattle is productive of money and beasts, and does not\r\ntherefore deserve to be confiscated unless cultivation of crops is\r\nimpeded thereby.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of robbers and wild tribes, robbers are\r\never bent on carrying off women at night, make assaults on\r\npersons, and take away hundreds and thousands of panas, whereas\r\nwild tribes, living under a leader and moving in the neighbouring\r\nforests can be seen here and there causing destruction only to a\r\npart.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, robbers carry off the property of the\r\ncareless and can be put down as they are easily recognized and\r\ncaught hold of, whereas wild tribes have their own strongholds,\r\nbeing numerous and brave, ready to fight in broad daylight, and\r\nseizing and destroying countries like kings.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 775516, "end_char_idx": 779822, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81e57464-4028-4380-aae9-c5a728561b86": {"__data__": {"id_": "81e57464-4028-4380-aae9-c5a728561b86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "22f42739-69fc-41a2-aab4-32604e233bad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "52f6bbf3da4cfa416a714a1251eebb24b6bba884aca7d93f03bcb38cab4ae2a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "92759f45-d916-43f7-aabe-4eab89207248", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5fa8f9a62a9ab204ea81b79fc8d5d703501562ea0e1c51bd8736c47f6c69a4ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "My teacher says that of robbers and wild tribes, robbers are\r\never bent on carrying off women at night, make assaults on\r\npersons, and take away hundreds and thousands of panas, whereas\r\nwild tribes, living under a leader and moving in the neighbouring\r\nforests can be seen here and there causing destruction only to a\r\npart.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, robbers carry off the property of the\r\ncareless and can be put down as they are easily recognized and\r\ncaught hold of, whereas wild tribes have their own strongholds,\r\nbeing numerous and brave, ready to fight in broad daylight, and\r\nseizing and destroying countries like kings.\r\n\r\nOf the forests of beasts and of elephants, beasts are numerous\r\nand productive of plenty of flesh and skins;

THE KNOWLEDGE OF POWER, PLACE,\r\nTIME, STRENGTH, AND WEAKNESS; THE TIME OF\r\nINVASION.\r\n\r\nTHE conqueror should know the comparative strength and\r\nweakness of himself and of his enemy; and having ascertained the\r\npower, place, time, the time of marching and of recruiting the\r\narmy, the consequences, the loss of men and money, and profits\r\nand danger, he should march with his full force; otherwise, he\r\nshould keep quiet.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of enthusiasm and power, enthusiasm is\r\nbetter: a king, himself energetic, brave, strong, free from disease,\r\nskilful in wielding weapons, is able with his army as a secondary\r\npower to subdue a powerful king; his army, though small, will,\r\nwhen led by him, be, capable of turning out any work. But a king\r\nwho has no enthusiasm in himself, will perish though possessed of\r\na strong army.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, he who is possessed of power overreaches,\r\nby the sheer force of his power, another who is merely enthusiastic.\r\nHaving acquired, captured, or bought another enthusiastic king as\r\nwell as brave soldiers, he can make his enthusiastic army of horses,\r\nelephants, chariots, and others to move anywhere without\r\nobstruction. Powerful kings, whether women, young men, lame or\r\nblind, conquered the earth by winning over or purchasing the aid of\r\nenthusiastic persons.\r\n\r\nMy teacher says that of power (money and army) and skill in\r\nintrigue, power is better; for a king, though possessed of skill for\r\n\r\n490\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nintrigue (mantrasakti) becomes a man of barren mind if he has no\r\npower; for the work of intrigue is well defined. He who has no\r\npower loses his kingdom as sprouts of seeds in drought vomit their\r\nsap.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, skill for intrigue is better; he who has the\r\neye of knowledge and is acquainted with the science of polity can\r\nwith little effort make use of his skill for intrigue and can succeed\r\nby means of conciliation and other strategic means and by spies\r\nand chemical appliances in over-reaching even those kings who are\r\npossessed of enthusiasm and power. Thus of the three\r\nacquirements, viz., enthusiasm, power and skill for intrigue, he\r\nwho posesses more of the quality mentioned later than the one\r\nmentioned first in the order of enumeration will be successful in\r\nover- reaching others.\r\n\r\nCountry (space) means the earth; in it the thousand yojanas of\r\nthe northern portion of the country that stretches between the\r\nHimalayas and the ocean form the dominion of no insignificant\r\nemperor; in it there are such varieties of land, as forests, villages,\r\nwaterfalls, level plains, and uneven grounds. In such lands, he\r\nshould undertake such works as he considers to be conducive to his\r\npower and prosperity.

Some say that place is the best\r\nfor the reason that a dog, seated in a convenient place, can drag a\r\ncrocodile and that a crocodile in low ground can drag a dog.\r\n\r\nOthers say that time is the best for the reason that during the\r\nday-time the crow kills the owl, and that at night the owl] the crow.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, of strength, place, and time, each is helpful\r\nto the other; whoever is possessed of these three things should,\r\nafter having placed one-third or one fourth of his army to protect\r\nhis base of operations against his rear-enemy and wild tribes in his\r\nvicinity and after having taken with him as much army and treasure\r\nas is sufficient to accomplish his work, march during the month of\r\nMdrgdsirsha (December) against his enemy whose collection of\r\nfood-stuffs is old and insipid and who has not only not gathered\r\nfresh food-stuffs, but also not repaired his fortifications, in order to\r\ndestroy the enemy's rainy crops and autumnal handfuls (mushti).\r\nHe should march during the month of Chaitra (March), if he means\r\nto destroy the enemy's autumnal crops and vernal handfuls. He\r\nshould march during the month of Jyestha (May-June) against one\r\nwhose storage of fodder, firewood and water has diminished and\r\nwho has not repaired his fortifications, if he means to destroy the\r\nenemy's vernal crops and handfuls of the rainy season. Or he may\r\nmarch during the dewy season against a country which is of hot\r\nclimate and in which fodder and water are obtained in little\r\nquantities.

or when he thinks that\r\nhis enemy has a strong hereditary army famous for its attachment,\r\nand is, therefore, to be fought out with much skill on his part; or\r\nwhen he thinks that though the roads are good and the weather\r\nfavourable, it is still the hereditary army that can endure wear and\r\ntear;

or when he thinks that other kinds of force\r\nare wanting in strength, then is the time for taking the hereditary\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nWhen he thinks that the army he has hired is greater than his\r\nhereditary army;

The king should get rid of such an internal enemy\r\neither by giving up his own fault or by pointing out the danger\r\narising from an external enemy. When the priest is guilty of the\r\ngravest treason, relief should be found either by confining him or\r\nby banishing him; when the heir-apparent is so, confinement or\r\ndeath (nigraha), provided that there is another son of good\r\ncharacter. From these, the case of the minister and the\r\ncommander-in-chief is explained.\r\n\r\nWhen a son, or a brother, or any other person of the royal\r\nfamily attempts to seize the kingdom, he should be won over by\r\nholding out hopes; when this is not possible, he should be\r\nconciliated by allowing him to enjoy what he has already seized, or\r\nby making an agreement with him, or by means of intrigue through\r\nan enemy, or by securing to him land from an enemy, or any other\r\nperson of inimical character. Or he may be sent out on a mission\r\nwith an inimical force to receive the only punishment he deserves;\r\nor a conspiracy may be made with a frontier king or wild tribes\r\nwhose displeasure he has incurred; or the same policy that is\r\nemployed in securing an imprisoned prince or in seizing an\r\nenemy's villages may be resorted to.\r\n\r\nThe provocation of ministers other than the prime minister is\r\nwhat is called the internal ministerial troubles. Even in this case,\r\nnecessary strategic means should be employed.\r\n\r\nThe provocation of the chief of a district (rdshramukhya), the\r\nofficer in charge of the boundary, the chief of wild tribes, and a\r\nconquered king is what is termed external trouble. This should be\r\novercome by setting one against the other.

CONSIDERATION ABOUT LOSS OF MEN,\r\nWEALTH, AND PROFIT.\r\n\r\nLoss of trained men is what is called kshaya, loss of men.\r\nDiminution of gold and grains is loss of wealth.\r\n\r\nWhen the expected profit overweighs both these; then one\r\nshould march (against an enemy).\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of an expected profit are: that which is\r\nreceivable, that which is to be returned, that which pleases all, that\r\nwhich excites hatred, that which is realised in a short time, that\r\nwhich entails little loss of men to earn, that which entails little loss\r\nof wealth to earn, that which is vast, that which is productive, that\r\nwhich is harmless, that which is just, and that which comes first.\r\n\r\nWhen a profit is easily acquired and secured without the\r\nnecessity of returning it to others, it is termed \u2018receivable\u2019; that\r\nwhich is of the reverse nature is \u2018repayable\u2019; whoever goes to\r\nreceive a repayable profit or is enjoying it gets destruction.\r\n\r\nWhen he, however, thinks that \"by taking a repayable profit 1\r\nshall cause my enemy\u2019s treasury, army, and other defensive\r\nresources to dwindle; I shall exploit to impoverishment the mines,\r\ntimber and elephant forests, irrigational works and roads of traffic\r\nof my enemy; I shall impoverish his subjects, or cause them to\r\nmigrate, or conspire against him; when they are reduced to this\r\ncondition, my enemy inflames their hatred (by punishing them); or\r\nI shall set my enemy against another enemy; my enemy will give\r\nup his hopes and run away to one who has some blood-relationship\r\n\r\n503\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nwith him; or having improved his lands, 1 shall return them to him,\r\nand when he is thus brought to ascendancy, he will be a lasting\r\nfriend of mine,\"--then he may take even a repayable profit.

EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL DANGERS.\r\n\r\nTHE formation of a treaty and other settlements otherwise\r\n\r\n505\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nthan they ought to have been made is impolicy. From it arise\r\ndangers.\r\n\r\nThe various kinds of dangers are: that which is of external\r\norigin and of internal abetment; that which is of internal origin and\r\nof external abetment; that which is of external origin and of\r\nexternal abetment; and that which is of internal origin and of\r\ninternal abetment.\r\n\r\nWhere foreigners carry on an intrigue with local men or local\r\nmen with foreigners, there the consequence of the intrigue carried\r\non by the combination of local and foreign persons will be very\r\nserious. Abettors of an intrigue have a better chance of success than\r\nits originators; for when the originators of an intrigue are put down,\r\nothers will hardly succeed in undertaking any other intrigue.\r\nForeigners can hardly win over local persons by intrigue; nor can\r\nlocal men seduce foreigners. Foreigners will find their vast efforts\r\nafter all unavailing, and only conducive, to the prosperity of the\r\nking (against whom they want to conspire).\r\n\r\nWhen local persons are abetting (with foreigners), the means\r\nto be employed to suppress them are conciliation (sdma) and gifts\r\n(ddna).\r\n\r\nThe act of pleasing a man with a high rank and honour is\r\nconciliation; favour and remission of taxes or employment to\r\nconduct state-works is what is termed gifts.\r\n\r\nWhen foreigners are abetting, the king should employ the\r\npolicy of dissension and coercion. Spies under the guise of friends\r\nmay inform foreigners: \"Mind, this man is desirous of deceiving\r\nyou with the help of his own spies who are disguised as traitors.\u201d\r\nSpies under the garb of traitors may mix with traitors and separate\r\nthem from foreigners, or foreigners from local traitors.

Other\r\nspies, pretending to be friends, should inform these kings of the\r\nnecessity of destroying the particular king.\r\n\r\nWhen an enemy's brave soldier, elephant, or horse dies, or is\r\nkilled, or carried off by spies, other spies may tell the enemy that\r\nthe death is due to mutual conflict among his followers.

Thus the procedure of setting to work.\r\n\r\nWhen the surrounding circumstances are conducive to\r\nwealth, it is known as wealth from all sides.\r\n\r\nWhen the acquirement of wealth from all sides is obstructed\r\nby an enemy in the rear, it takes the form of dangerous wealth\r\ninvolved in doubts.\r\n\r\nIn these two cases, success can be achieved by securing the\r\nhelp of a friend and the enemy of the rear-enemy.\r\n\r\nWhen there is reason to apprehend fear from enemies on all\r\n\r\n515\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nsides, it is a dangerous trouble; when a friend comes forward to\r\navert this fear, that trouble becomes involved in doubt. In these two\r\ncases, success can be achieved by securing the support of a\r\nnomadic enemy and the enemy of the rear-enemy.\r\n\r\nWhen the prospect of acquiring profit from one or the other\r\nside is irremediably obstructed by enemies, it is called \"dangerous\r\nwealth.\u201d In this case as well as in the case of profit from all sides,\r\none should undertake to march for acquiring profitable wealth.\r\nWhen the prospects of getting wealth (from two sides) are equal,\r\none should march to secure that which is important, near, unfailing,\r\nand obtainable by easy means.\r\n\r\nWhen there is the apprehension of harm from one quarter as\r\nwell as from another, it is wealth beset with danger from two sides.\r\nIn this case as well as in the case of wealth involved in danger from\r\nall sides, success is to be desired with the help of friends. In the\r\nabsence of friends, he should attempt to ward off harm from one\r\nside with the help of an ally who can be easily won over; he should\r\nward off harm from two sides with help of an ally of superior\r\npower; and he should ward off harm from all sides with all the\r\nresources he can command. When it is impossible to do this, he\r\nshould run away, leaving all that belongs to him; for if he lives, his\r\nreturn to power is certain as in the case of Suydtra and Udayana.\r\n\r\nWhen there is the prospect of wealth from one side and the\r\napprehension of an attack from another, it is termed a situation\r\nbeset with wealth and harm. In this case, he should march to\r\nacquire that wealth which will enable him to ward off the attack;\r\notherwise he should attempt to avert the attack.

In this, he should ward off the harm first; when this is done,\r\nhe should attempt to acquire the doubtful wealth. This explains the\r\ndoubtful situation of harm and wealth from all sides.\r\n\r\nWhen there is the prospect of wealth from one side and the\r\napprehension of doubtful harm from another, it is a doubtful\r\nsituation of harm and wealth from two sides. This explains the\r\nsituation of doubtful harm and wealth from all sides. In this, he\r\nshould attempt to ward off the doubts of harm against each of the\r\nelements of his sovereignty in order; for it is better to leave a friend\r\nunder circumstances of doubtful harm, than the army; also the\r\narmy may be left under circumstances of doubtful harm, but not the\r\ntreasury. When all the elements of his sovereignty cannot be\r\nrelieved from harm, he should attempt to relieve some of them at\r\nleast. Among the elements, he should attempt to relieve first those\r\nanimate elements which are most loyal, and free from firebrands\r\nand greedy men; of inanimate elements (he should relieve) that\r\nwhich is most precious and useful. Such elements as are capable of\r\neasy relief may be relieved by such means as an agreement of\r\npeace, observance of neutrality, and making peace with one and\r\nwaging war with another. Those which require greater efforts may\r\nbe relieved by other means.\r\n\r\nOf deterioration, stagnation and progress, he should attempt\r\nto secure that which is mentioned later in the order of enumeration;\r\nor in the reverse order, if he finds that deterioration and other\r\nstages are conducive to future prosperity. Thus the determination\r\nof situations. This explains the situation of doubtful harm and\r\nwealth in the middle or at the close of a march.\r\n\r\nSince doubts of wealth and harm are constantly associated\r\nwith all expeditions, it is better to secure wealth by which it is easy\r\nto destroy an enemy in the rear and his allies, to recoup the loss of\r\nmen and money, to make provisions during the time of sojourning\r\n\r\n517\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nabroad, to make good what is repayable, and to defend the state.\r\nAlso harm or doubtful prospects of wealth in one's own state are\r\nalways intolerable.\r\n\r\nThis explains the situation of doubtful harm in the middle of\r\nan expedition. But at the close of an expedition, it is better to\r\nacquire wealth either by reducing or destroying a reducible or\r\nassailable enemy than to get into a situation of doubtful harm, lest\r\nenemies might cause troubles. But, for one who is not the leader of\r\ncombination of states, it is better to risk the situation of doubtful\r\nwealth or harm in the middle or at the close of an expedition, since\r\none is not obliged to continue the expedition.\r\n\r\nWealth, virtue, and enjoyment form the aggregate of the three\r\nkinds of wealth. Of these, it is better to secure that which is\r\nmentioned first than that which is subsequently mentioned in the\r\norder of enumeration.\r\n\r\nHarm, sin and grief form the aggregate, of the three kinds of\r\nharm. Of these, it is better to provide against that which is\r\nmentioned first, than that which is subsequently mentioned.\r\n\r\nWealth or harm, virtue or sin, and enjoyment or grief, are the\r\naggregate of the three kinds of doubts. Of these, it is better to try\r\nthat which is mentioned first than that which is mentioned later in\r\nthe order of enumeration, and which it is certain to shake off.

Thus ends the discourse on\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nRegarding success in these dangerous situations and times: in\r\nthe case of troubles from sons, brothers or relatives, it is better to\r\nsecure relief by means of conciliation and gifts; in the case of\r\ntroubles from citizens, country people, or chiefs of the army, it is\r\nby means of gifts and sowing the seeds of dissension; in the case of\r\n\r\n518\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\ntroubles from a neighbouring king or wild tribes, it is by means of\r\nsowing the seeds of dissension and coercion. This is following the\r\norder of the means. In other kinds of situations, the same means\r\nmay be employed in the reverse order.\r\n\r\nSuccess against friends and enemies is always achieved by\r\ncomplicated means; for strategic means help each other. In the case\r\nof suspected ministers of an enemy, the employment of\r\nconciliation does not need the use of the other means; in the case of\r\ntreacherous ministers it is by means of gifts; in the case of\r\ncombination of states, it is by means of sowing the seeds of\r\ndissension; and in the case of the powerful, it is by means of\r\ncoercion.\r\n\r\nWhen grave and light dangers are together apprehended, a\r\nparticular means, or alternative means or all the means may be\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nBy this alone, but not by any other means, is what is meant\r\n\r\nby a particular means.\r\n\r\nBy this or that, is what is meant by alternative means.\r\nBy this as well as by that, is what is meant by all the means.\r\n\r\nOf these, the single means as well as the combination of any\r\nthree means are four; the combinations of any two means are six;\r\nand the combination of all the four is one. Thus there are fifteen\r\nkinds of strategic means. Of the same number are the means in the\r\nreverse order.\r\n\r\nWhen a king attains success by only one means among these\r\nvarious means, he is called one of single success; when by two, one\r\nof double success; when by three, one of treble success; and when\r\nby four, one of four-fold success.\r\n\r\n519\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nAs virtue is the basis of wealth and as enjoyment is the end of\r\nwealth, success in achieving that kind of wealth which promotes\r\nvirtue, wealth and enjoyment is termed success in all\r\n(sarvdrthasiddhi). Thus varieties of success.\r\n\r\nSuch providential visitations as fire, floods, disease,\r\npestilence (pramara), fever (vidrava), famine, and demoniac\r\ntroubles are dangerous.\r\n\r\nSuccess in averting these is to be sought by worshipping\r\ngods and Brahmans.\r\n\r\n* Whether demoniacal troubles are absent, or are too many, or\r\nnormal, the rites prescribed in the Atharvaveda as well as the rites\r\nundertaken by accomplished ascetics are to be performed for\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n[Thus ends Chapter VII, \u201cDoubts about Wealth and Harm; and\r\nSuccess to be Obtained by the Employment of Alternative\r\nStrategic Means\u201d in Book IX, \u201cThe Work of an Invader,\u201d of the\r\nArthasdstra of Kautilya.

The array in which the\r\nfront is occupied by elephants, the flanks by chariots, and the\r\nwings by horses is an array which can break the centre of the\r\nenemy's army; the reverse of this can harass the extremities of the\r\nenemy's army. An array of elephants may also be made: the front\r\nby such elephants as are trained for war; the flanks by such as are\r\ntrained for riding; and the wings by rogue elephants. In an array of\r\nhorses, the front by horses with mail armour; and the flanks and\r\nwings by horses without armour.

THE DUTIES OF A MESSENGER.\r\n\r\nWHEN a king of poor resources is attacked by a powerful\r\nenemy, he should surrender himself together with his sons to the\r\nenemy and live like a reed (in the midst of a current of water).\r\n\r\nBhdradvdja says that he who surrenders himself to the strong,\r\nbows down before Indra (the god of rain).\r\n\r\nBut Visdldksha says that a weak king should rather fight with\r\nall his resources, for bravery destroys all troubles; this (fighting) is\r\nthe natural duty of a Kshatriya, no matter whether he achieves\r\nvictory or sustains defeat in battle.\r\n\r\nNo, says Kautilya, he who bows down to all like a crab on the\r\nbanks (of a river) lives in despair; whoever goes with his small\r\narmy to fight perishes like a man attempting to cross the sea\r\nwithout a boat. Hence, a weak king should either seek the\r\nprotection of a powerful king or maintain himself in an\r\nimpregnable fort.\r\n\r\nInvaders are of three kinds: a just conqueror, a demon-like\r\nconqueror, and a greedy conqueror.\r\n\r\nOf these, the just conqueror is satisfied with mere obeisance.\r\nHence, a weak king should seek his protection.\r\n\r\nFearing his own enemies, the greedy conqueror is satisfied\r\nwith what he can safely gain in land or money. Hence, a weak king\r\nshould satisfy such a conqueror with wealth.\r\n\r\n547\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nThe demon-like conqueror satisfies himself not merely by\r\nseizing the land, treasure, sons and wives of the conquered, but by\r\ntaking the life of the latter. Hence, a weak king should keep such a\r\nconqueror at a distance by offering him land and wealth.\r\n\r\nWhen any one of these is on the point of rising against a weak\r\nking, the latter should avert the invasion by making a treaty of\r\npeace, or by taking recourse to the battle of intrigue\r\n(mantrayuddha), or by a treacherous fight in the battle-field. He\r\nmay seduce the enemy's men either by conciliation or by giving\r\ngifts, and should prevent the treacherous proceedings of his own\r\nmen either by sowing the seeds of dissension among them or by\r\npunishing them. Spies, under concealment, may capture the\r\nenemy's fort, country, or camp with the aid of weapons, poison, or\r\nfire. He may harass the enemy's rear on all sides; and he may\r\ndevastate the enemy's country through the help of wild tribes. Or he\r\nmay set up a scion of the enemy's family or an imprisoned prince to\r\nseize the enemy's territory. When all this mischief has been\r\nperpetrated, a messenger may be sent to the enemy, (to sue for\r\npeace); or he may make peace with the enemy without offending\r\nthe latter.

The\r\nterritory that has been conquered should be kept so peacefully that\r\nit might sleep without any fear. When it is in rebellion, it is to be\r\npacified by bestowing re-wards and remitting taxes, unless the\r\nconqueror means to quit it. Or he may select his battle fields in a\r\nremote part of the enemy's territory, far from the populous centres;\r\nfor, in the opinion of Kautilya, no territory deserves the name of a\r\nkingdom or country unless it is full of people. When a people resist\r\nthe attempt of the conqueror, then he may destroy their stores,\r\ncrops, and granaries, and trade.\r\n\r\n* By the destruction of trade, agricultural produce, and\r\nstanding crops, by causing the people to run away, and by slaying\r\n\r\n575\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\ntheir leaders in secret, the country will be denuded of its people.\r\n\r\nWhen the conqueror thinks: \"My army is provided with\r\nabundance of staple corn, raw materials, machines, weapons, dress,\r\nlabourers, ropes and the like, and has a favourable season to act,\r\nwhereas my enemy has an unfavourable season and is suffering\r\nfrom disease, famine and loss of stores and defencive force, while\r\nhis hired troops as well as the army of his friend are in a miserable\r\ncondition,\"--then he may begin the siege.\r\n\r\nHaving well guarded his camp, transports, supplies and also\r\nthe roads of communication, and having dug up a ditch and raised a\r\nrampart round his camp, he may vitiate the water in the ditches\r\nround the enemy's fort, or empty the ditches of their water or fill\r\nthem with water if empty, and then he may assail the rampart and\r\nthe parapets by making use of underground tunnels and iron rods.\r\nIf the ditch (dvdram) is very deep, he may fill it up with soil. If it is\r\ndefended by a number of men, he may destroy it by means of\r\nmachines. Horse soldiers may force their passage through the gate\r\ninto the fort and smite the enemy.

Having anointed one's own\r\neyes with the above, one can clearly see things at night.\r\n\r\nHaving fasted for three nights, one should, on the day of the\r\nstar, Pushya, catch hold of the skull of a man who has been killed\r\n\r\n596\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nwith a weapon or put to the gallows. Having filled the skull with\r\nsoil and barley seeds, one should irrigate them with the milk of\r\ngoats and sheep. Putting on the garland formed of the sprouts of the\r\nabove barley crop, one can walk invisible to others.\r\n\r\nHaving fasted for three nights and having afterwards pulled\r\nout on the day of the star of Pushya both the right and the left eyes\r\nof a dog, a cat, an owl, and a vdguli (7), one should reduce them to\r\ntwo kinds of powder. Then having anointed one's own eyes with\r\nthis ointment as usual, one can walk invisible to others.\r\n\r\nHaving fasted for three nights, one should, on the day of the\r\nstar of Pushya, prepare a round-headed pin (saldkd) from the\r\nbranch of purushaghdti (punndga tree). Then having filled with\r\nointment (anjana) the skull of any of the animals which roam at\r\nnights, and having inserted that skull in the organ of procreation of\r\na dead woman, one should burn it. Having taken it out on the day of\r\nthe star of Pushya and having anointed one's own eyes with that\r\nointment, one can walk invisible to others.\r\n\r\nWherever one may happen to see the corpse burnt or just\r\nbeing burnt of a Brdhman who kept sacrificial fire (while alive),\r\nthere one should fast for three nights; and having on the day of the\r\nstar of Pushya formed a sack from the garment of the corpse of a\r\nman who has died from natural causes, and having filled the sack\r\nwith the ashes of the Brdhman's corpse, one may put on the sack on\r\none's back, and walk invisible to others.\r\n\r\nThe slough of a snake filled with the powder of the bones and\r\nmarrow or fat of the cow sacrificed during the funeral rites of a\r\nBrdhman, can, when put on the back of cattle, render them\r\ninvisible.\r\n\r\nThe slough of prachaldka (a bird?)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 975160, "end_char_idx": 978921, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4dfe9ecc-59b1-427c-b9a7-852bdf6cef5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4dfe9ecc-59b1-427c-b9a7-852bdf6cef5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a06ebf2-85b1-47db-b679-b81bcc967895", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ba4b333e51b1729f3621fad7076bd992c6812bc024d083757a200005f440e54d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "47b18cc0-4813-426d-b2c8-5c73a051a1a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d0f6ff26d748ba361a9cb456f1fd58dbe5df2296423fc65a9e68525bd4499ec1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Wherever one may happen to see the corpse burnt or just\r\nbeing burnt of a Brdhman who kept sacrificial fire (while alive),\r\nthere one should fast for three nights;

association with the aged;\r\ncontrol of the organs of sense; the creation of ministers, and the\r\nlike.\"\r\n\r\nPointing out similar facts by the use of such words as \u2018These\r\nand the like,\u201d is suggestion of similar facts; for example: \"The\r\nworld consisting of the four castes and the four religious divisions\r\nand the like.\"\r\n\r\nThe sense which a word has to convey is its meaning; for\r\nexample, with regard to the words muilahara: \"Whoever squanders\r\nthe wealth acquired for him by his father and grandfather is a\r\nmiilahara, prodigal son.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhat is meant to prove an assertion is the purport of reason;\r\nfor example: \"For charity and enjoyment of life depend upon\r\nwealth.\u201d\r\n\r\nSaying in one word is mentioning a fact in brief; for example:\r\n\"It is the control of the organs of sense on which success in learning\r\nand discipline depend.\u201d\r\n\r\nExplanation in detached words is the mentioning of a fact in\r\ndetail; for example: \"Absence of discrepancy in the perception of\r\nsound, touch, colour, flavour, and scent by means of the ear, the\r\nskin, the eyes, the tongue, and the nose, is what is meant by\r\nrestraint of the organs of sense.\"\r\n\r\nSuch statement as \"Thus one should live,\u201d is guidance; for\r\n\r\nexample: \"Not violating the laws of righteousness and economy, he\r\nshould live.\u201d\r\n\r\n608\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nSuch statement, as \u2018he says thus,\u2019 is a quotation; for example:\r\n\"The school of Manu say that a king should make his assembly of\r\nministers consist of twelve ministers; the school of Brihaspati say\r\nthat it should consist of sixteen ministers; the school of Usans say it\r\nshould contain twenty members; but Kautilya holds that it should\r\ncontain as many ministers as the need of the kingdom requires.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen a rule dwelt upon in connection with a question is said\r\nto apply to another question also, it is termed application; for\r\nexample: \"What is said of a debt not repaid holds good with failure\r\nto make good a promised gift.\"\r\n\r\nEstablishing a fact by what is to be treated of later on is \u201cplace\r\nof reference; for example: \"By making use of such strategic means\r\nas conciliation, bribery, dissension, and coercion, as we shall\r\nexplain in connection with calamities.\u201d\r\n\r\nProving an unseen thing or course of circumstances by what\r\nhas been seen is simile; for example: \"Like a father his son, he\r\nshould protect those of his subjects who have passed the period of\r\nthe remission of taxes.\"\r\n\r\nWhat naturally follows from a statement of facts, though not\r\nspoken of in plain terms, is implication; for example, \"Whoever\r\nhas full experience of the affairs of this world should, through the\r\nmedium of the courtiers and other friends, win the favour of a king\r\nwho is of good character and worthy sovereign. It follows from this\r\nthat no one should seek the favour of a king through the medium of\r\nthe king's enemies.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen the statement of a reason is equally applicable to two\r\ncases of circumstances, it is termed doubt; for example: \"Which of\r\nthe two should a conqueror march against: one whose subjects are\r\nimpoverished and greedy, or one whose subjects are oppressed?\u201d\r\n\r\n609\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nWhen the nature of procedure to be specified in connection\r\nwith a thing is said to be equal to what has already been specified in\r\nconnection with another, it is termed reference to similar\r\nprocedure; for example: \"On the lands allotted to him for the\r\npurpose of carrying on agricultural operations, he should do as\r\nbefore.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe inference of a reverse statement from a positive\r\nstatement is termed contrariety; for example: \"The reverse will be\r\nthe appearance of a king who is not pleased with the messenger.\"", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 995530, "end_char_idx": 999618, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4c747a4-585a-4519-9fe6-5d4be51d0b48": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4c747a4-585a-4519-9fe6-5d4be51d0b48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83c3096b-51ca-43dc-bfcd-2c5bea7aae37", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "ffa0a07c53c23897ff4c7b75d05744d26a968024856e5aad9cd458c96a35ba2a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "99a37521-a91a-44dc-a547-9225145a5cea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "C:\\Users\\OMEN\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Warmup\\Sarvadnya_internship\\src\\ask_kautilya\\data\\Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_name": "Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_English.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 1005976, "creation_date": "2025-07-01", "last_modified_date": "2025-07-01"}, "hash": "66b8de57047c01af5416b8ea867e3203e4fb9359167d760a18390a1ce4add54a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9afabe80-ce9f-4ec2-a366-4d707195403d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "14c2fb4e5c2add4ac92a4e4c77d7c60af4bda3fbff4847a71c45bbaa1f8a9ee0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "That portion of a sentence which is omitted, though necessary\r\nto convey a complete sense, is ellipsis; for example: \"With his\r\nfeathers plucked off, he will lose his power to move.\" Here \u2018like a\r\nbird\u2019 is omitted.\r\n\r\nWhen the opinion of another person is stated but not refuted,\r\nit is acceptance of that opinion; for example: \u201cWings, front, and\r\nreserve, is the form of an array of the army according to the school\r\nof Usanas.\u201d\r\n\r\nDescription in detail is explanation; for example: \"Especially\r\namongst assemblies and confederacies of kings possessing the\r\ncharacteristics of assemblies, quarrel is due to gambling ; and\r\ndestruction of persons due to the quarrel. Hence, among evil\r\npropensities, gambling is the worst evil, since it renders the king\r\npowerless for activity.\u201d\r\n\r\nStating the derivative sense of a word, is derivation; for\r\nexample: \"That which throws off (vyasyati) a king from his\r\nprosperous career is propensity (vyasana).\r\n\r\nThe mentioning of a fact to illustrate a statement, is\r\nillustration; for example: \"In war with a superior, the inferior will\r\nbe reduced to the same condition as that of a foot-soldier fighting\r\n\r\n610\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nwith an elephant.\u201d\r\n\r\nRemoval of an undesired implication from a statement is\r\nexception; for example: \"A king may allow his enemy's army to be\r\npresent close to his territory, unless he suspects of the existence of\r\nany internal trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\nWords which are not used by others in the special sense in\r\nwhich they are used by the author are his own technical terms; for\r\nexample: \"He who is close to the conqueror\u2019s territory is the first\r\nmember; next to him comes the second member; and next to the\r\nsecond comes the third.\"\r\n\r\nThe citation of another's opinion to be refuted, is prima facie\r\nview; for example: \"Of the two evils, the distress of the king and\r\nthat of his minister, the latter is worse.\u201d\r\n\r\nSettled opinion is rejoinder; for example: \"The distress of the\r\nking is worse, since everything depends upon him; for the king is\r\nthe central pivot, as it were.\"\r\n\r\nThat which is universal in its application is conclusion or an\r\nestablished fact: for example: \"A king should ever be ready for\r\nmanly effort.\u201d\r\n\r\nDrawing attention to a later chapter is reference to a\r\nsubsequent portion; for example: \"We shall explain balance and\r\nweights in the chapter, \u2018The Superintendent of Weights and\r\nMeasures.\"\r\n\r\nThe statement that it has been already spoken of is reference\r\nto a previous portion: for example, \"The qualifications of a\r\n\r\nminister have already been described.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2018Thus and not otherwise\u2019 is command; for example: \"Hence\r\n\r\n611\r\nKautilya's Arthashastra\r\n\r\nhe should be taught the laws of righteousness and wealth, but not\r\nunrighteousness and non-wealth.\"\r\n\r\n\u201cThis or that\u2019 is alternative; for example: \"or daughters born\r\nof approved marriage (dharmaviviha).\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2018Both with this and that\u2019 is compounding together, for\r\nexample: \"Whoever is begotten by a man on his wife is agnatic\r\nboth to the father and the father's relatives.\u201d\r\n\r\nThat which is to be determined after consideration is\r\ndeterminable fact; for example: \"Experts shall determine the\r\nvalidity or invalidity of gifts so that neither the giver nor the\r\nreceiver is likely to be hurt thereby.\u201d\r\n\r\n* Thus this Sdstra, conforming to these paragraphic divisions is\r\ncomposed as a guide to acquire and secure this and the other world.\r\n* In the light of this Sdstra one cannot only set on foot righteous,\r\neconomical, and aesthetical acts and maintain them, but also put\r\ndown unrighteous, uneconomical and displeasing acts.\r\n\r\n* This Sdstra has been made by him who from intolerance\r\n(of misrule) quickly rescued the scriptures and the science of\r\nweapons and the earth which had passed to the Nanda king.\r\n\r\n[Thus ends the Chapter I, \u2018Paragraphic divisions of the\r\nTreatise\u2019 in the fifteenth Book, \u2018Plan of Treatise.\u201d This is the one\r\nhundred and fiftieth chapter from the first chapter of the entire\r\nwork.
