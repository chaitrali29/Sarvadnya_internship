# RAG on Paired Data

A generic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) framework to fetch responses from multiple formats such as docs, code, SQL and testcases.

<!-- 
## Prompt
```
You are an expert in llamaindex coding. Need to build chatbot application PoC using streamlit ui, open source models from groq and llamaindex.



Here is the problem for which code needs to be written using the RAG(retrieval augmented generation) approach. Here RAG training or indexing data is in MS Excel with two columns format. First column is English query and second column is of the response. The type of response can vary as below:

-¬† paragraph for FAQ chatbot

-¬† sql for text 2 sql application¬†

-¬† testing steps for QA application¬†

-¬† code blog for coding application¬†



Generate sample excel for all the above types, read them in python code, index them chormadb and build full end to end application using llamaindex framework



Here indexing is done for the first column primarily and when user query comes, it's matched in index for the first column and top k corresponding answers from second column are brought in the prompt for response generation. If there is any ready class for such Rag approach, use it or code it from scratch.
```

Refinement

```
Split the code in app.py into two files app.py which contains primarliy srtealit code and then rag.py for rag related llamaindex code, make rag code into a class, test it with some examples in __main__ below that file , streamlit from app.y should just instantiate rag class and call it's member functions
``` 
-->

**How the RAG works here?:**

1.  **User Query:** You type a question.
2.  **Embedding:** Your query is converted into a vector by the `HuggingFaceEmbedding` model.
3.  **Similarity Search:** This vector is compared against all the vectors of the "English Query" column entries stored in ChromaDB.
4.  **Retrieval:** The `top_k` most similar "English Query" entries are retrieved along with their associated `metadata` (which contains your "Response" from Excel).
5.  **Prompt Augmentation:** The retrieved queries and their responses are formatted into a prompt for the Groq LLM.
6.  **Generation:** The Groq LLM uses this augmented prompt to generate a final, coherent answer. It's guided to use the direct Excel responses if they are highly relevant.

-----

** What makes it different?:**
‚úÖ One System, Multiple Use Cases: FAQ responses, SQL generation, QA testing steps, and code snippets 
‚úÖ Excel-Powered Knowledge Base: Non-technical users can easily update training data 
‚úÖ Modern Tech Stack: LlamaIndex + ChromaDB + Groq + Streamlit 
‚úÖ Cost-Effective: Leverages open-source models with fast inference 
‚úÖ Production-Ready?: Complete implementation is there but of academic level, not ready to use or is production worthy.

Okay, I can help you build this RAG chatbot PoC\! üßë‚Äçüíª

Here's how we'll approach it:

1.  **Sample Excel Data:** I'll define the structure and provide examples for your four types of Q\&A.
2.  **Core LlamaIndex & Groq Logic:** We'll set up the environment, load data, index it using ChromaDB, and configure a RAG pipeline with a Groq LLM.
3.  **Streamlit UI:** We'll wrap everything in a simple Streamlit interface.

Let's get started\!

## üìù Sample Excel Data

You'll need to create four separate Excel files. Here's the structure and some examples. Let's name them:

  * `faq_data.xlsx`
  * `text2sql_data.xlsx`
  * `qa_testing_data.xlsx`
  * `coding_blog_data.xlsx`

**Common Structure (for all files):**

Two columns:

  * **Column A:** `English Query`
  * **Column B:** `Response`

## üêç Python Code (LlamaIndex, Groq, Streamlit)

Now, let's write the Python script.

**Prerequisites:**

1.  **Install libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install llama-index streamlit pandas openpyxl llama-index-embeddings-huggingface llama-index-llms-groq llama-index-vector-stores-chromadb chromadb
    ```
2.  **Groq API Key:**
      * Sign up at [Groq Cloud](https://console.groq.com/keys).
      * Get an API key.
      * Set it as an environment variable: `GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"`

**Python Script (`app.py`):**

**Explanation and Key Changes:**

1.  **`dotenv` for API Key:** Added `python-dotenv` to manage the `GROQ_API_KEY` if you place it in a `.env` file in the same directory as `app.py`. Create a `.env` file with:
    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY="your_actual_groq_api_key"
    ```
2.  **LlamaIndex Settings (`configure_llamaindex`)**:
      * Uses `HuggingFaceEmbedding` with `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for efficient local embeddings.
      * Uses `Groq` for the LLM, configured with your API key and chosen model (`llama3-8b-8192` is a good default).
      * Sets a global `Settings.chunk_size`.
      * The function is cached with `@st.cache_resource` so settings are initialized once.
3.  **Data Loading (`load_data_from_excel`)**:
      * Reads the "English Query" and "Response" columns.
      * Creates `llama_index.core.Document` objects.
      * **Crucially**:
          * `text=query`: The content of the document that gets embedded and searched against is the "English Query".
          * `metadata={"response": response, "filename": ...}`: The actual "Response" from your Excel sheet is stored in the document's metadata. This is key for our RAG approach. We also store the filename for traceability.
4.  **Vector Index Creation (`create_vector_index`)**:
      * Uses `ChromaVectorStore` for local, persistent storage.
      * A `db_path` and `collection_name` are specified to allow the index to be saved and reloaded across sessions.
      * It tries to `get_collection` first; if it fails (e.g., `DoesNotExistError` or similar, though `chromadb` might raise its own specific errors which a general `except` catches), it creates a new one.
      * `VectorStoreIndex.from_documents` is used to build the index if it's new.
      * `VectorStoreIndex.from_vector_store` is used if loading an existing one.
      * The function is cached with `@st.cache_resource`.
5.  **RAG Querying (`query_rag_index`)**:
      * It takes the user query and retrieves the `top_k` most similar documents (which are your "English Query" rows) using `index.as_retriever()`.
      * **Core RAG Logic**:
          * It extracts the `response` from the `metadata` of each retrieved node.
          * It then constructs a detailed prompt for the Groq LLM. This prompt includes:
              * The original user query.
              * The retrieved "English Query" (as `Retrieved Question`) and its corresponding "Response" from Excel (as `Retrieved Answer`).
          * The LLM's task is to synthesize an answer based on this context, prioritizing direct answers if a retrieved question closely matches the user's query. This way, for exact or very similar FAQ-like questions, you'll get the pre-defined Excel response. For more nuanced queries, the LLM can combine or rephrase.
6.  **Streamlit UI**:
      * **File Uploader:** Allows uploading multiple Excel files.
      * **Processing Button:** Triggers data loading and index creation/loading.
      * **Persistent Index:** The script now tries to save the ChromaDB index to a local directory (`./chroma_db_excel_poc`) and load it if it exists on subsequent runs, even if no files are uploaded initially. This avoids re-indexing every time if the data hasn't changed.
      * **Chat Interface:** Standard Streamlit chat elements.
      * **Retrieved Information Display:** An expander shows the `matched_query`, the `response` from Excel, the similarity `score`, and the `source` file for each retrieved document, giving transparency.
      * **State Management (`st.session_state`):** Used to store the `vector_index`, `messages` for the chat, and `data_loaded` status across reruns.
      * **Error Handling:** Basic checks for API keys, file formats, and index availability.
7.  **Directory for ChromaDB:** The script will create a directory (e.g., `chroma_db_excel_poc`) in the same location as `app.py` to store the vector database. Ensure your environment has write permissions there.

**To Run the Application:**

1.  Save the Python code above as `app.py`.
2.  Create the sample `.xlsx` files in the same directory (or provide paths to them).
3.  Make sure your `GROQ_API_KEY` is set as an environment variable or in a `.env` file.
4.  Open your terminal in that directory and run:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
5.  Your browser should open with the Streamlit application.
6.  Upload your Excel files, click "Process Files & Build/Load Index", and then start chatting\!
