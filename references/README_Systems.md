## What is System Dynamics?
**System Dynamics** (SD) is a methodology for understanding the nonlinear behavior of complex systems over time. It employs stocks, flows, internal feedback loops, and time delays to model dynamic interactions within systems. Originally developed in the 1950s for corporate management, it now finds applications across various sectors including public policy, healthcare, and environmental studies[1][3][5].

## Key Concepts
- **Feedback Loops**: Chains of cause-and-effect relationships that influence system behavior.
- **Stocks and Flows**: Represent accumulations (stocks) and changes (flows) within a system.
- **Modeling and Simulation**: Using computational tools to simulate system behavior under different scenarios.
- **Policy Design**: Utilizing insights gained from models to inform decision-making and strategy development[1][5].

## Installation
To get started with System Dynamics modeling, you may need specific software tools. Below are some popular options:
- **Vensim**: A powerful tool for building SD models.
- **Stella Architect**: User-friendly software for creating dynamic models.
- **AnyLogic**: A versatile simulation software that supports SD modeling.

Installation instructions vary by software; please refer to the respective documentation for details.

## Usage
1. **Define the Problem**: Identify the key issues you want to address within your system.
2. **Map the System**: Create a causal loop diagram to visualize feedback loops and interactions.
3. **Build the Model**: Use simulation software to quantify relationships between variables.
4. **Run Simulations**: Test different scenarios to observe potential outcomes.
5. **Analyze Results**: Use findings to inform decision-making and policy design.
