# Tarang-Tantra
**‡§§‡§∞‡§ô‡•ç‡§ó‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞** ‚Äî *The System of Waves*

Welcome to **Tarang-Tantra**, a comprehensive resource and toolkit dedicated to the science and art of Signal Processing. Our goal is to explore, understand, and implement a wide range of signal processing techniques that drive modern-day applications, from audio processing and image analysis to communications and beyond.


In Sanskrit, Tantra (‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞)  conveys multiple meanings that align well with concepts like technique, methodology, system, or even processing. Traditionally, Tantra refers to a structured set of practices, methods, or techniques, often applied systematically to achieve a particular outcome or understanding.

In the context of Tarang-Tantra:

- Tarang means wave or signal.
- Tantra here can imply a systematic technique or method, which fits perfectly with the concept of signal processing as a structured method for analyzing and interpreting signals.
So, Tarang-Tantra effectively translates to Signal Processing or The System of Signal Techniques.

## üìú Overview
This repository embodies a systematic approach to analyzing, transforming, and interpreting waves and signals.

This repository is designed for:
- **Students** and **researchers** seeking foundational concepts and implementations.
- **Engineers** and **developers** looking for practical algorithms and code.
- **Enthusiasts** who want to dive into the science behind sound, vision, and communications.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Signal Analysis**: Time-domain and frequency-domain analysis techniques.
- **Noise Reduction**: Methods for signal denoising and enhancement.
- **Machine Learning in Signal Processing**: Integrating machine learning models for predictive and classification tasks in signal contexts.

### Why?

**Tarang-Tantra** is more than a repository; it‚Äôs a purposeful project inspired by the concept of **Ikigai** ‚Äî the intersection of passion, mission, profession, and vocation in signal processing. The approach combines:

- **Diverse Domain Applications**:
  - **Sleep Analysis**
  - **Medical Diagnostics**
  - **Financial Forecasting**
  - **Sensor Data Interpretation**
  - **Music and Speech Processing**

- **Mathematical Foundations**:
  - Techniques like **Wavelets** and **Fourier Transforms** to analyze and interpret signals effectively.

- **Technical Approaches**:
  - A spectrum of methods, from **rule-based processing** to **advanced AI/ML techniques**.
  - Support for **time-series analysis**, **signal sequences**, and **pattern recognition**.

- **Specific Knowledge (by Naval Ravikant)**:
  - Unique fusion of **Yoga Nidra** and **AI-driven signal processing** to explore wellness and mindfulness applications.

- **Future Goals**:
  - Develop **talks**, **training sessions**, and **micro-SaaS solutions**.
  - Design **wearable technology** for continuous signal monitoring and interpretation.
  - Enable **passive income** opportunities by building products that generate ongoing value.

**Tarang-Tantra** is crafted to serve as a comprehensive toolkit, an educational resource, and a platform for innovative products, all at the intersection of modern signal processing and meaningful application.


## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To make the most of **Tarang-Tantra**, ensure you have:
- **Python** 3.8+ installed
- Essential libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `librosa`, and `sklearn`

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Tarang-Tantra.git
cd Tarang-Tantra
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìÇ Repository Structure
- **/src**: Core algorithms and implementations.
- **/examples**: Jupyter notebooks and scripts demonstrating use cases.
- **/docs**: Documentation for each module, including theoretical background.
- **/tests**: Unit tests to ensure accuracy and robustness of code.

## üìò Documentation
Comprehensive documentation is available in the `/docs` folder, including:
- **Theoretical Concepts**: Detailed explanations of each signal processing technique.
- **Code Examples**: Step-by-step tutorials on implementing and using algorithms.
- **Applications**: Practical applications in fields like audio, image, and communication.

## üöÄ Usage
To get started with **Tarang-Tantra**, you can run any example notebook in the `/examples` folder:
```bash
python examples/basic_signal_analysis.py
```

### Example: Basic Signal Filtering
Here‚Äôs a simple example of using **Tarang-Tantra** to filter a noisy signal:
```python
import numpy as np
from src.filters import apply_lowpass_filter

# Generate a sample noisy signal
fs = 500  # Sampling frequency
t = np.linspace(0, 1, fs)
signal = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 50 * t) + 0.5 * np.random.randn(fs)

# Apply a lowpass filter
filtered_signal = apply_lowpass_filter(signal, cutoff=30, fs=fs)
```

## üìà Roadmap
Planned enhancements include:
- **Motif identification**: repeated patterns 
- **Anomaly detection**:
- **Matrix profile**: stumpy, sax 
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Using neural networks for classification and regression tasks on signals.
